\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to the following individuals
who contributed to this work: \name{Jiapeng~Huang}, for his enthusiasm
and focussed efforts in carrying out many tedious but necessary experiments,
\name{Yuqiang~Wu} for establishing the DNA related protocols,
\name{Matthew~Foreman} for insightful theoretical modeling
of SPP multiple scattering, \name{Frank~Vollmer} for his optimism
in seeing this work to a successful completion, \name{Stephen~Gregory}
and \name{R\@.P.\@~Schumann} whose pioneering experiments are the basis
for my own, and \name{Yuki~Sato} for his patience and progressive
scientific ideas. Most significantly, I would like to recognize
\name{Norbert~Lindlein}, without whom this dissertation would not be
possible.
