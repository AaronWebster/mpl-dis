%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS %%%%
I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to the following individuals
who contributed to this work: \name{Jiapeng~Huang}, for his enthusiasm and
focussed efforts in carrying out many tedious but necessary experiments,
\name{Yuqiang~Wu} for establishing the DNA related protocols,
\name{Matthew~Foreman} for insightful theoretical modeling of SPP multiple
scattering, \name{Frank~Vollmer} for his optimism in seeing this work to a
successful completion, \name{Stephen~Gregory} and \name{R\@.P.\@~Schumann}
whose pioneering experiments are the basis for my own, and \name{Yuki~Sato}
for his patience and progressive scientific ideas. This gratitude is also
extended to to \name{Martin~Baaske} who seemed sad that his name wasn't
mentioned.  Most significantly, I would like to recognize
\name{Norbert~Lindlein}, without whom this dissertation would not be
possible.
