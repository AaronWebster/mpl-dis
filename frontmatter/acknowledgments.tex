\name{Matthew~Foreman} for carrying out insightful theoretical modeling
regarding SPP multiple scattering, \name{Frank~Vollmer} for his optimism
in seeing this work to a successful completion, \name{Stephen~Gregory}
and \name{R\@.P.\@~Schumann} whose pioneering experiments are the basis
for my own, and \name{Yuki~Sato} for his patience and progressive
scientific ideas regarding his centrifugal force quartz crystal
microbalance.  Most significantly, I would like to recognize
\name{Norbert~Lindlein}, without whom this dissertation would not be
