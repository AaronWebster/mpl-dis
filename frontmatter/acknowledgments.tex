%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS %%%%
I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to the following individuals who
contributed to this work: \name{Jiapeng~Huang}, for his enthusiasm and focused
efforts in carrying out many tedious but necessary experiments,
\name{Yuqiang~Wu} for establishing the DNA related protocols,
\name{Matthew~Foreman} for insightful theoretical modeling of SPP multiple
scattering and for significant contributions to the quality of this
dissertation, \name{Frank~Vollmer} for his creativity and optimism in seeking
out new ideas and seeing this work to a successful completion,
\name{Stephen~Gregory} and \name{R\@.P.\@~Schumann} whose pioneering
experiments are the basis for my own, and \name{Yuki~Sato} for his patience and
progressive scientific ideas regarding the CF-QCM\@. This gratitude is also
extended to \name{Martin~Baaske} who knows where I'm coming from.  Most
significantly, I would like to recognize \name{Norbert~Lindlein} who invited me
to Germany and showed me true scientific rigor, without whom this dissertation
would not be possible.
