The gold films were depositied through a sputtering process at
\SI{0}{\angstrom\per\second} (DC \SI{0}{\milli\ampere}) under argon
atmosphere at \SI{12}{x}.

(quality of the film it produced)

(that you can control the surface roughness by doing things, such as
heating)

%A \SI{2}{\percent} solution of Hellmanex II was prepared in a pyrex beaker
%with a volume of \SI{25}{\milli\liters} and heated to a temperature of
%\SI{60}{\celsius} on a hot plate.  The BK7 slides are placed in this
%solution on the hot plate and washed for \SI{300}{\second}, swirling gently
%by hand occasionally.  The container with the solution and slides is then
%sonicated for \SI{300}{\second}.  

After sonication, the Hellmanex II solution is drained from the beaker and
replaced 5x with distilled water, swishing

rinse 5x with distilled water
rinse some amount of times with isopropanol
take each one
