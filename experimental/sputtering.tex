Metal films were fabricated using a standard top-down plasma sputtering process
in Argon at a pressure of \SI{1}{\milli\torr} and a mass flow rate of
\SI{12}{STP}.  The deposition was \SI{6.60}{\angstrom\per\second} for gold and
\SI{5.88}{\angstrom\per\second} for silver at 150 and \SI{66}{\watt} DC,
respectively.  During sputtering, the samples were rotated at \SI{50}{RPM}.
Though adhesion of the metal films to both glass and fluoropolymer substrates
was poor, instances of in-situ film-substrate separation were rare (observed
five times over the course of approximately fifty experiments).  It was
observed that film-substrate separation was instigated by stresses caused by
pressure differentials in the microfluidic flow cell.  The majority of such
stresses were mitigated by employing a natural siphon effect to flow liquids at
low rates through the microfluidic cell in lieu of mechanically forced flow.

The substrate material consisted of a \SI{12}{\milli\meter} diameter BK7
N\raisebox{0.25em}{\relsize{-2}\b{o}}~1 glass coverslip.  Coverslips were
cleaned in a hot base bath.  A \SI{2}{\percent} solution of Hellmanex II was
first prepared in a pyrex beaker with a volume of \SI{25}{\milli\liter} and
heated to a temperature of \SI{60}{\celsius} on a hot plate.  The BK7
coverslips were immersed for \SI{300}{\second}.  The beaker was then removed
from the hot plate and put in a sonicator for \SI{300}{\second}.  After
sonication, the coverslips were removed from the solution and washed liberally
with distilled water and dried under a dry nitrogen stream.  Cleaned coverslips
were stored individually on top of a small \SI{1}{\milli\meter\cubed} piece of
PDMS plasma bonded to a microscope coverslip, and prepared batches were kept in
a dark box until use.  Coverslips sputtered with metal films were always used
within one or two days to forestall contamination or possible oxidation (in the
case of silver films).

For the scattering experiments discussed in \Chapter{ch:speckle}
and~\ref{ch:scatteringmicro}, the substrate was bonded to a hemispherical prism
using NOA89 UV-cured optical adhesive.  NOA89 is well characterized for optical
applications with a high spectral transmission and a refractive index of
approximately 1.51 across the visible and near IR\@.  The prism material
consisted of either BK7 or NOA89 cast in a hemispherical mould made from BK7
prisms cast in PDMS\@.  Once the BK7 prism was removed from the PDMS, the void
was filled with NOA89 and cured under a \SI{15}{\watt} UV lamp at a distance of
\SI{5}{\centi\meter} for \SI{12}{\hour}.  To remove bubbles, the UV adhesive
was first centrifuged in an opaque microcentrifuge tube at \SI{15000}{RPM} for
\SI{30}{\minute}.  As the substrate construction is independent of the prism
material and both NOA89 and BK7 have nearly the same refractive index
(approximately 1.51 at \SI{660}{\nano\meter}), the two cases are not
distinguished except to note that the NOA89 prisms are easier to fabricate in
bulk.

For the interference experiments discussed \Chapter{ch:interference}, prisms of
either LAH79 or BK7 were used with the metal film sputtered directly onto the
prism's hypotenuse.  Such glass prisms were prepared by first removing any
existing metal film.  Silver films were removed by immersion in
\SI{70}{\percent} \ce{HNO3} for \SI{60}{\second}.  Gold films were removed
similarly by immersion in freshly prepared aqua regia, composed of a 1:3 ratio
of \ce{HNO3} to \ce{HCl}.  The glass prisms were sonicated in acetone to remove
any organic contaminants and rinsed in ultra-pure dry acetone with a final cleaning with methanol and lens tissue using the drag and drop method.
