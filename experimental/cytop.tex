A fluoropolymer, poly(1,1,2,4,4,5,5,6,7,7-decafluoro-3-oxa-1,6-heptadiene),
more commonly referred to by its commercial name Cytop, was employed to
make multilayer substrates supporting long range surface plasmons.

At an operating wavelength of \SI{660}{\nano\meter} and at
\SI{20}{\celsius}, the refractive index of Cytop is very close to water --
1.341 for Cytop~\cite{mikevs2005synthesis} versus 1.331 for distilled
water~\cite{andreasson1971measurement}.  The similar refractive index
allows a near-symmetric refractive index profile required for long range
surface plasmons.

Cytop was purchased from AGC Chemicals as item number CTX-809A.  The last
letter ``A'' in the item number designates it is intended for use on
amorphous (glass) applications, and the subsequent number designates the
concentration.  For example, CTX-809A is \SI{9}{\percent} cytop and
\SI{91}{\percent} solvent, and likewise CTX-803A is \SI{3}{\percent} cytop
and \SI{97}{\percent} solvent.  Atachi manufactures another item with an
``M'' designation designed for metals, but in either case the multilayer
structure would have one side in contact with a non-optimal material.
Similar to the metal layers described in \Section{sec:expsputtering}, the
adhesion of the cytop to both metals and glass was very poor, but with
careful handling is not an issue.

The thin films were made following a spin-coating procedure.  A small drop
of CTX-809A was placed directly on a clean \SI{12}{\milli\meter} round
glass slide and the slide spun at \SI{3000}{RPM} for \SI{30}{\second}.
Immediately after the slide was removed and placed on a hot plate at
\SI{50}{\celsius} for \SI{30}{\minute}.  The temperature of the hot plate
was then increased to \SI{200}{\celsius} and the Cytop allowed to cure for
\SI{12}{\hour} to remove any remaining solvent.  After cooling, the metal
films were sputtered directly without any further surface modification.

The resultant film thicknesses were determined with a spectrometer by
measuring its broadband reflectance at $\theta=\SI{45}{\degree}$ and using
a nonlinear least squares routine~\cite{more1977LevAlgImpThe_2} to 
fit the Fresnel intensity reflection coefficient for a single layer
film $R$~\cite{steck2006classical} 
\begin{equation}
 R = \frac{n_1^2(n_i-n_s)^2 \cos^2\delta + (n_i n_s - n_1^2)^2\sin^2\delta}
          {n_1^2(n_i+n_s)^2 \cos^2\delta + (n_i n_s + n_1^2)^2\sin^2\delta}
          \label{eqn:fitfresnel}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
 \delta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_0} n_i d_i \cos \theta
\end{equation}
and the Cytop layer has a refractive index $n_i$ and thickness $d_i$, the
substrate a refractive index $n_s$, and the system in the presence of
refractive index $n_1$ (air).  \Equation{eqn:fitfresnel} assumes the
reflection coefficient for TE polarization, which 
\Equation{eqn:fitfresnel} has only one free parameter: $d_i$, which was
solved for using a linear least squares fitting algorithm.
An example of the raw spectrometer data and and its best fit is shown in
\Figure{fig:fresnelfit}.

The surface quality of the Cytop films was not measured, but the
experiments suggest this value to be small; the intensity of light
scattered into the cone is too small to be observed when exciting SPPs in
an unmodified cytop-gold-water setup -- additional surface features must be
added before the cone becomes visible.  This observatino stands in
comparison to experiments in the traditional glass-silver-air and
glass-gold-water setups where the cone is always found to be visible.
