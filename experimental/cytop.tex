For the fabrication of multilayer substrates supporting long range surface
plasmons, we used a flouropolymer,
poly(1,1,2,4,4,5,5,6,7,7-decafluoro-3-oxa-1,6-heptadiene), better known by
its brand name Cytop.

Cytop was purchased from AGC Chemicals as item number CTX-809A.  The last
letter ``A'' in the item number designates it is intended for use on
``amorphous'' (i.e. glass) applications, and the number immediately
following that designates the concentration.  For example, CTX-809A is
\SI{9}{\percent} cytop and \SI{91}{\percent} solvent, and likewise CTX-803A
is \SI{3}{\percent} cytop and \SI{97}{\percent} solvent.
