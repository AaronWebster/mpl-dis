During the course of the present experimental work, a standard programmable
spin coater was not available.  Being a rather expensive piece of
equipment, a device was made in its stead using a repurposed spinning
platter type hard disk drive.  Spin coaters built in this fashion have been
reported before~\cite{bianchi2006spin}, but herein is described a much
simpler and economic implementation using off the shelf components.

The cover from all internal components except for the motor are first
removed.  A solid aluminum plate is affixed to the top of the motor using
the existing screw taps.  The three leads of the hard disk's three phase
motor are connected directly to a programmable electronic speed controller
(ESC).  The ESC itself is a standard component found in most land and air
based radio controlled drones.  Once configured, the ESC accepts a pulse
width modulated (PWM) input with pulse widths varying from
\SI{1000}{\micro\second} (off) to \SI{2000}{\micro\second} (full speed).
The PWM signal for the ESC is generated by an Arduino Uno platform, based
on the Atmel ATMega128 \SI{8}{\bit} microcontroller.  The Arduino is
programmed for several preset spin sequences which are initialized by
pressing a button.  Finally, connected to the motor spindle is a small
flange and an optical interrupter switch which serves to monitor the spin
speed.  

The spin speed of the motor was recorded as a function of PWM signal and
the relationship fit to a second order polynomial.  The fit parameters were
then used to set the PWM output given a desired spin speed without
feedback.

The stability of the spin coater and the range of speeds it offers is shown
in \Table{tbl:spincoatererror}.  Perhaps the most obvious downside of the
ESC is that it does not operate very well in the low RPM limit,
particularly at around \SI{2800}{RPM}.
