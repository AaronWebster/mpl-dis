for plasma bonding I do exactly this:

The experimental setup is depicted schematically in
\Figure{fig:sppexperimentalsetup}.  Light from a \SI{660}{\nano\meter}
diode laser is first coupled into a single mode optical fiber.  The fiber
guides the laser light to an optical breadboard mounted on an inverted
microscope.  All primary functions of the experiment take place here.  The
Gaussian output from the single mode fiber is collimnated with a beam waist
$w_0=\SI{5}{\milli\meter}$ and proceeds
through a polarizing beamsplitter, passing $p$ polarized light.  This light
is focused by a 10x microscope objective onto the
hypotenuse of a hemispherical prism.  The prism is mounted on a planar
structure supporting either normal or long range SPPs.  Reverse of this
structure is a microfluidic flow cell where samples can be injected.  The
specularly reflected and scattered light containing information from SPP
interference and scattering is ultimately captured at desired locations by
a pair of custom beam profilers. (notch filter).

\section{Planar Layer Structure}
Perhaps most important to the setup is the layer structure supporting SPP
propagation.  Two types of structures were created for this work: ones for
SPPs and LRSPPs.
