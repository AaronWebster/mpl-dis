To prepare the camera data for data analysis, the next step in the post-processing workflow involves ``unwrapping'' the cone image; transforming the
hyperbolic shape on the image sensor into a straight one.  The unwrapping step
is accomplished using the software program Fiji~\cite{schindelin2012fiji} and a
straightening algorithm based on cubic spline
interpolation~\cite{kocsis1991image}.  The procedure is depicted in \Figure{fig:extractspklineschematic}.
