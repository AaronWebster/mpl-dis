For convenience in analyzing the data, the next step in the post processing
workflow involves ``unwrapping'' the speckle line; transforming the
hyperbolic shape on the image sensor into a straight one.  We accomplish
this with the software program Fiji~\cite{schindelin2012fiji} and a
straightening algorithm based on cubic spline
interpolation~\cite{kocsis1991image}.
