Once the coordinates have been determined, 

the subsequent image processing
depends on the type of experiment being carried out.  For speckle
experiments, the intensity variation along the cone's altitude coordinate
$\theta$ is not important.  Thus we wish to extract 

The first step in the post processing technique is to ``unwrap'' the
