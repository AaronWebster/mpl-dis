Several methods were developed to control surface roughness.  The first
method was to heat the substrate to \SI{200}{\celsius} immediately prior to
sputtering.  After sputtering, the substrates were allowed to cool slowly
at room temperature before use.  This method was able to increase the
measured surface roughness by nearly two fold (see
\Chapter{ch:scatteringmicro} for analysis).

The second method used nanoparticles to modify the surface.  15, 50, 75,
and \SI{100}{\nano\meter} citrate capped spherical gold nanoparticles were
obtained for this purpose.  We observed that, at varying dillutions in
deionized water, the
