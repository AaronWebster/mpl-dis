Prism coupled excitation of SPPs were carried out using a modified
experimental setup based on the simple Kretschmann attenuated total reflection
(ATR) configuration, shown as an annotated image in
\Figure{fig:experimentalpicture} and schematically in
\Figure{fig:experimentalsetup}.  Light from a \SI{50}{\milli\watt}
\SI{660}{\nano\meter} diode laser (Ingis 660, Laser Quantum Ltd.) with a
bandwidth of \SI{30}{\giga\hertz} is first coupled into a single mode optical
fiber via an integrated air-spaced doublet fiber collimator.  The fiber guides
the laser light to an optical breadboard mounted on an inverted microscope.
All primary functions of the experimental setup take place on the breadboard.
At the breadboard stage, the Gaussian beam from the single mode fiber is
collimated by an output coupler to a beam waist of $w_0=\SI{5}{\milli\meter}$
and proceeds through a polarizing beamsplitter, passing $p$ polarized light.
The light is focused by a 10X microscope objective (Olympus plan achromat,
$\mathrm{NA}=0.25$, \SI{10.6}{\milli\meter} working distance) onto the
hypotenuse of a hemispherical prism of diameter $d=\SI{10}{\milli\meter}$.
The beamsplitter and microscope objective are mounted on a rotation stage
which itself is mounted on a micrometer stage.  The objective itself is
mounted on a zoom housing enabling linear travel along the optical axis,
greatly simplifying the task of focussing.  When the rotation stage is at the
surface plasmon resonance angle, the micrometer $z$ axis is fixed with a
near-diffraction limited spot at the center of the prism's hypotenuse.  The
size of the spot can then be modified via the zoom housing, and its transverse
location on the surface by the $x$ and $y$ lead screws on the micrometer
stage.

The hemispherical prism is mounted on a planar structure supporting either
normal or long range SPPs.  Reverse of the structure is a microfluidic flow
cell where samples are introduced.  Both the microfluidics and the
substructure supporting the prism are thin and optically transparent.  In
this way, the sensing surface may be imaged with the objective on the
inverted microscope.  The breadboard containing the experiment was fixed to
the optical table with its own micrometer stage, permitting translation of
the entire experiment in the plane of the optical table, and thus a way to
position the inverted microscope objective without disturbing the rest of
the setup.

The hemispherical prism affords a useful optical feature with regards to the
optical system.  If the focal spot is positioned at the central point of the
hemispherical prism's hypotenuse and the focussing optic obeys the sine
condition, a minimum amount of abberation will be introduced by the presence
of the hemispherical prism.  To take advantage of this feature, a microscope
objective was chosen to as the focussing optic.  The use of a microscope
objective and hemispherical prism is not strictly necessary; previous versions
of the experimental setup made use of an $f=\SI{25}{\milli\meter}$ aspheric
lens for focussing and a \SI{25}{\milli\meter} diameter,
$f=\SI{20}{\milli\meter}$ aspheric condenser lens as an ersatz hemispherical
prism.  The aspheric focussing and condenser lens does distort the incident
and reflected light precluding a diffraction limited spot, however this choice
affords qualatatively the same physics with a much lower cost.

Extra attention was not given to mechanical stability.  Though the quality of
the optomechanical components was acceptable, the mounting of imaging sensors
and the prism extended on a glass slide were less than what would
typically be considered optically rigid.  Despite this, no effects were
observed on the specular or cone sensor which could be attributed to
mechanical instability, however the image from the inverted microscope
objective exhibited low frequency ($<\SI{5}{\hertz}$) displacements coincident
with transient events in the laboratory: footsteps, opening and shutting of
doors, etc.  Such artifacts when present were corrected for after data
acquisition with image stabilization functions built in to the software
program Fiji~\cite{schindelin2012fiji}.

\subsection{Imaging Sensor}
Three identical imaging sensors were employed concurrently to acquire
experiemntal data.  The imaging sensors used were IDS USB 2.0 \SI{8}{\bit}
CMOS sensors with a spatial resolution of $1280\times1024$ pixels.  The
sensors were capable an ``limited area of interest'' (AOI) capture mode,
allowing a subset of the available pixel region to be transmitted via the
serial bus to the host computer.  Under sufficient lighting, framerates of
up to \SI{250}{fps} (frames per second) were possible with the smallest AOI
region.  In practice, the cone, specular, and surface images were all
acquired at \SI{100}{fps}.

To allow the cone sensor to capture the largest angular region of the cone
possible, the sensor was removed from its housing and its naked PCB used as
a mount support (\Figure{fig:imagingsensor}).  Removing the housing allowed
the cone sensor to be positioned approximately \SI{10}{\milli\meter} from
the focal spot and to capture an angular region of approximately
\SI{37}{\degree}.

A modified version of the program \texttt{ueyedemo} included with the IDS
UEye SDK version 3.82 was used to read the raw sensor data directly from
memory and write it to a single binary file on the disk of the host
computer.  The modifications afforded the data acquisition several speed
advantages compared with the stock software included with the IDS sensors.
First, all calls to image or video libraries were suppressed by removing
the need to transcode the pixel data, instead writing raw pixel data
directly to disk.  Second, the raw pixel data was saved to a single file,
eliminating seeking of the computer's physical disk read/write head during
both file creation and updating the disk's filesystem journal when
acquiring data as an image sequence.

On the hardware side, each imaging sensor was given its own dedicated USB
bus, maximizing the USB polling frequency and avoiding other bus traffic
which would otherwise retard the sensor datastream.
