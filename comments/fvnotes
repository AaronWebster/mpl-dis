here are a few comments already:

p.48: do you have experimental examples for seperating the three cases (many scatters, small number of scatterers, single strong scatterer dominates)?

p.51: so should we have more explanation as to why the theory does not aply

p.51:seems unclear to me what part of the theory is actually applicable to the experiment.....

fig.5.4: should we have an explanation for this discrepancy?

fig. 6.3:can you show more data like this,
many steps in a series, etc.?
perhaps several runs?


fig.6.5:perhaps show some of the raw data you used to compile these plots

to me this is one of the most exciting aspects, can you elaborate more on future potential?
