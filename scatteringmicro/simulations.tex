Two different types of simulations were used to study the influence of
scattering microstructure on light in the cone.  The first is an
approximation based on a Monte Carlo model of SPP multiple scattering.
This method is slow, but allows us to separate the influence of different
types of scattering events.  The second is faster and more exact, based on
dipole-dipole interactions.  Both are based on interpreting the scattering
microstructure as a collection of discrete scatterers, rather than a
continuum of roughness.  Here we describe both methods.
