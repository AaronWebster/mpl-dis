Central to these experiments is the generation of a topology map known
colloquially as ``weirdospace''.  Weirdospace is quite simply
a two-dimensional map of the intensity in the far field as a function of tip
position.

We begin by assigning the tip position on the prism surface the coordinates
$(x,y,z=0)$, and the position on the detector as
$(x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime)$.  The detector field has two phase
contributions: the first from the local SPP field, $\ksp x$, and the second
from propagation into the far field, Together,
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime) = \exp\!{\left( \mi\ksp x + \mi k_0\sqrt{{(x-x^\prime)}^2+{(y-y^\prime)}^2+ {(z-z^\prime)}^2 } \right)}
\end{equation}
or, in spherical coordinates,
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(\rho,\theta,\phi) = \exp\!{\left( \mi\ksp x + %
\mi k_0\sqrt{{(\rho\sin\theta\cos\phi x+x)}^2+{(\rho\sin\theta\sin\phi+y)}^2+{(\rho\cos\theta+z)}^2 } \right)}
\label{eqn:dingusthusly}
\end{equation}
If we assume the detector is in the far field, $\rho\gg\lambda_0$, we can
make a couple of approximations.  First, we neglect the additional optical
path length accumulated propagating through the prism.  Second, if we
consider the path length \textit{difference} between the origin and the far field,
$\rho$, we can simplify \Equation{eqn:dingusthusly} thusly
\begin{align}
				\mathbf{E}(\rho,\theta,\phi) &= \exp\!{\left( \mi\ksp x + %
				\mi k_0{\left(\rho-\sqrt{{(\rho\sin\theta\cos\phi x+x)}^2+{(\rho\sin\theta\sin\phi+y)}^2+{(\rho\cos\theta+z)}^2
				}\right)} \right)}\\
				\mathbf{E}(\rho\gg\lambda,\theta,\phi) &= \exp\!{\big( \mi \ksp x
				+ \mi k_0 \sin\theta {\left(x\cos\phi+y\sin\phi\right)}
				+ \varphi\big)}
	\label{eqn:primarystripes}
\end{align}
where we have included the variable $\varphi$ to represent the complex phase term
from non-tip-scattering events (a coherent background).

\Equation{eqn:primarystripes} shows a fundamental feature of weirdospace.
For sufficiently strong tip scattering a set of angled interference stripes
will be present.  We call this feature \textit{primary stripes},
frequency and orientation of which is a function of $\phi$.
\Figure{fig:primarystripes} shows this
dependence graphically for a simulated set of stripes.  Note that in
\Equation{eqn:primarystripes} we have not specified $\varphi$.  This term
could lead to higher order features in weirdospace, which we will discuss
in turn.
