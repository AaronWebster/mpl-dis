The use of nanoparticle adsorption as a scattering mechanism was inspired
by an experimental technique known as scanning plasmon nearfield optical
microscopy (SPOM).  This technique makes use of a sharp tungsten tip from a
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to interact with the local SPP field.
Such instruments have found great utility in X, Y, and Z.

In collaboration with \name{Gregory} of the University of Oregon, we have
analyzed a series of experimental datasets collected by
\name{Schumann}~\cite{schumann2009surface}.  The experimental protocol is
described in detail in~\cite{schumann2009surface}; here we breifly relay
the important points.  An N-BK7 hemisphere, diameter
\SI{24.5}{\milli\meter} was used as the supporting structure.  On the
prism's hypotenuse was deposited a thin layer of \ce{CaF2} to enhance the
surface roughness of the \SI{50}{\nano\meter} silver layer deposited above.
The prism was mounted in a vacuum housing and a \SI{632.8}{\nano\meter}
helium-neon laser was used at $\thetasp\approx\SI{44}{\degree}$ with a
$\mathrm{NA}=0.2$ Gaussian focal spot incident on the central point of the
hypotenuse, exciting SPPs on the metal-vacuum interface.  The cone was
projected onto a sheet of paper and recorded from above with an imaging
sensor.  In the vacuum housing, a sharp tungsten tip mounted on a
feedback-controlled piezo system is brought within the evanescent field of
the focussed beam.  The $z$ height of the tip is controlled my monitoring
the tunneling current between the tip and the sample.  The tip is then
rastered within a square region of the focal spot, and an image of the cone
is taken for every tip position in the raster.  Thus, the tip is a moving
scatterer amongst a fixed background and a powerful tool for exploring
surface plasmon random scattering.

Central to these experiments is the generation of a topology map known
colloqually as ``weirdospace''.  Weirdospace is, quite simply, a two
dimensional map of the intensity of a particular point on the cone as a
function of tip position.  

We begin by assigning the tip position on the
prism surface with two dimensional cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z=0)$, and
the far field intensity on the detector as $(x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime)$.
The far field has two phase contributions: the first from the local SPP field
$\ksp x$ and the second from propagation into the far field,
$k_0\left((x-x^\prime)^2+ (y-y^\prime)^2+
(z-z^\prime)^2\right)^{1/2}$.  Together, this yields
\begin{equation}
E(x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime) = \exp\left( \mi\ksp x + %
\mi k_0\sqrt{ (x-x^\prime)^2+ (y-y^\prime)^2+ (z-z^\prime)^2 } \right)
\end{equation}
or in spherical coordinates
\begin{equation}
E(\rho,\theta,\phi) = \exp\left( \mi\ksp x + %
\mi k_0\sqrt{
(\rho\sin\theta\cos\phix+x)^2+(\rho\sin\theta\sin\phi+y)^2+(\rho\cos\theta+z)^2 } \right)
\end{equation}
If we assume the detector is in the far field $\rho\gg\lambda_0$, we can
make a couple of approximations.  First, we neglect the additional optical
path length accumulated propagating through the prism.  Second, if we
consider the path length difference between the origin and the far field,
$\rho$, we can consider only the path length difference
\begin{align}
E(\rho,\theta,\phi) &= \exp\left( \mi\ksp x + %
\mi k_0(\rho-\sqrt{ (\rho\sin\theta\cos\phix+x)^2+(\rho\sin\theta\sin\phi+y)^2+(\rho\cos\theta+z)^2
}) \right)\\
&= \exp\!\big( \mi \ksp x
 + \mi k_0 \sin\theta \left(x\cos\phi+y\sin\phi\right)
 + \varphi\big)
	\label{eqn:primarystripes}
\end{align}
where we have assigned the variable $\varphi$ to represent the complex phase term
from non-tip-scattering events (a coherent background).  

\Equation{eqn:primarystripes} predicts an important feature of weirdospace.
For sufficiently strong tip scattering a set of angled interference stripes
will be present.  We call this feature \textit{primary stripes}.  The
frequency and orientation of primary stripes is a function of $\phi$ as per
\Equation{eqn:primarystripes}.  \Figure{fig:primarystripes} shows this
dependence graphically for a simulated set of stripes.  Note that in
\Equation{eqn:primarystripes} we have not specified $\varphi$.  This term
could lead to higher order features in wierdospace, which we will discuss
shortly.

We will now show that primary stripes allow enable reconstruction of the
phase of the far field speckle pattern.
