For each photometry map, the wavevectors $k_x$ and $k_y$ describing the
spatial frequency and orientation of the primary stripes was determined
from the peaks in its Fourier spectrum~\cite{huntley1989speckle}.  The
phase, $\varphi=\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0$, was similarly determined
by using the shift property of the Fourier transform
\begin{align}
\ff{\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0)}(\mathbf{k}) &= 
\me^{\mi \mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}_0}\,
\mathbf{E}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)\\
&= \me^{\mi \varphi}\, \mathbf{E}\left(\mathbf{k}\right)
\end{align}

Again, $k_x$, $k_y$, and $\varphi$ are parameters for weirdospace.  At
