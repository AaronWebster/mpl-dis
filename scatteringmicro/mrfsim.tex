We have constructed a theoretical model which enables fast simulation of
the re-radiated SPP field, including multiple scattering effects. The
system is modeled as a collection of $n$ dipoles with an induced moment of
$\mathbf{p}_n=\alpha \mathbf{E}_\mathrm{exc}(\mathbf{r}_n)$
from the exciting field $\mathbf{E}_0$. The local field $\mathbf{p}_k$ seen by
scatterer $k$ depends on the field from all other scatterers.
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{p}_k = \alpha_k \mathbf{E}_0 + \omega^2 \mu_0 \alpha_k
\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{r}_k,\mathbf{r}_k)
\label{eqn:foremandipole}
\end{equation}
