We have constructed a theoretical model which enables fast simulation of
the re-radiated SPP field, including multiple scattering effects. The
system is modeled as a collection of $n$ dipoles with an induced moment of
$\mathbf{p}_n=\tensor{\alpha} \mathbf{E}_\mathrm{exc}(\mathbf{r}_n)$
from the exciting field $\mathbf{E}_0$. The field $\mathbf{p}_k$ seen by
each scatterer depends on the field from all other scatterers
\begin{align}
\mathbf{p}_k =& \tensor{\alpha}_k \mathbf{E}_0(\mathbf{r}_k)
+\omega^2 \mu_0 \tensor{\alpha}_k \tensor{\mathbf{G}}_s(\mathbf{r}_k,\mathbf{r}_k)\mathbf{p}_k\\
+& \omega^2\mu_0 \sum_{\substack{n=1\\n \ne k}}^N
\tensor{\alpha}_k
\tensor{\mathbf{G}}(\mathbf{r}_k,\mathbf{r}_n)\mathbf{p}_n\qquad k=1,\ldots,N
\end{align}
and the total field $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$ is evaluated as the sum of each individual dipole field
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{E}_0(\mathbf{r}) + \omega^2 \mu_0
\sum_{n=1}^{N} \tensor{\mathbf{G}}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_n) \mathbf{p}_n
\end{equation}
