We now arrive on what is perhaps the most interesting aspect of our
studies: the influence of the scattering microstructure on the conically
scattered light.  Specifically, we will look at two important and closely
related problems.  They are%
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item the addition, and
\item the motion of
\end{inparaenum} %
a single scatterer amongst a fixed background.  Such topics belong to a
more general class of problems with important implications in many diverse
fields of study: diffusive wave spectroscopy~\cite{pine1988diffusing},
tracking and identification of targets with radio waves (the ``cruise
missile'' problem~\cite{atkins1991neural}), fluctuations in signal power in
cellular telephone networks~\cite{abdi2001estimation}, and very recently in
detecting stress fractures in aggregates such as
concrete~\cite{larose2010locating}.
