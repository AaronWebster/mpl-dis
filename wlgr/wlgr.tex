% With Greatly Limited Resources (WLGR)
% This section includes additional work on surface plasmon random scattering

This section presents additional work titled ``With Greatly Limited Resources, Part II: Surface Plasmon Random Scattering'' which explores numerical simulations, statistical properties, and various aspects of surface plasmon scattering phenomena.

The complete writeup is available as a supplementary document in the \texttt{sandbox/wlgr/} directory. Key topics covered include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Numerical simulation using Monte Carlo and analytic approaches
  \item Statistical properties of plasmon scattering
  \item Scattering permutations and microstructure
  \item Explanation of features in experimental observations
  \item Comparisons between experiment, simulation, and theory
\end{itemize}

For the full details and comprehensive analysis, readers are referred to \texttt{sandbox/wlgr/writeup.tex} and the associated PDF documents \texttt{wlgr-plasmon-webster.pdf}.
