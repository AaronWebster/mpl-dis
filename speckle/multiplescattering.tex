Thus far we have described speckle mathematically as a sum of random,
statistically independent, phasors.  This is in essence what is known as
\textit{single scattering}.  However, a much more interesting and
phenomenologically complex situation arises when we allow higher order
scattering processes to take over.  This is, unsurprisingly, known as
\textit{multiple scattering} and is a theme which will arise repeatedly in
our studies of surface plasmon random scattering.

Ioffe-Regel, $k_F l \gg 1$ ``mean free path is much larger than the Fermi
wavelength''.
