Consider an \gls{spp} excited by a focused beam in a prism-coupled setup.  Without
loss of generality, the center of the focused beam is defined as the origin
of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y,z)$.  If the beam is
incident in the $x$-$z$ plane, the \gls{spp} has an initial phase of $\exp(\mi \ksp
	x)$.  In the present analysis, the out of plane components of the Gaussian
beam are neglected.

As mentioned in \Section{sec:coneexist}, surface roughness or other
inhomogeneities can elastically scatter an \gls{spp} during propagation.  \gls{spp}
scattering on the surface changes the direction, but not the magnitude, of the
in-plane $k$-vector.  Upon re-radiation as a photon, the phase to a point
$(x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime)$ in the far field is
\begin{equation}
	\exp\!\left(\mi k_0 \sqrt{{(x-x^\prime)}^2 + {(y-y^\prime)}^2 + {(z-z^\prime)}^2}\right).
\end{equation}
In the present coordinate system, $z=0$ is the plane of scattering and the
contribution to the field by a single scattering event is
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{E}\big(x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime\big)=\exp\!\big( \mi \ksp x \big)
	\exp\!\left(\mi k_0 \sqrt{{(x-x^\prime)}^2 + {(y-y^\prime)}^2 + {(z-z^\prime)}^2}\right).
	\label{eqn:sppsinglescattering}
\end{equation}
\Equation{eqn:sppsinglescattering} assumes single scattering: an
\gls{spp} is scattered only once during its propagation.
%We will relax this
%assumption in \Section{sec:multiplescattering} when we consider multiple
%scattering.

It is further assumed that the $(x,y,z=0)$ coordinates from which an \gls{spp} is
re-radiated as a photon are randomly distributed following the treatment of
\name{Goodman}~\cite{goodman2007speckle} for random phasor sums.  To wit, the
field at each detector position $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$ is due to the
coherent linear superposition of $N$ random phasors
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n \me^{\mi \varphi_n},
	\label{eqn:phasorsum}
\end{equation}
where $a_n$ and $\varphi_n$ is the amplitude and phase of the $n$th phasor
and $\varphi$ is randomly distributed on the interval $(-\pi,\pi)$.  For
\gls{spp} scattering, $\varphi$ is the phase of \Equation{eqn:sppsinglescattering}.
In reality these conditions may be loosened by the physics of the actual
experiment, which we describe shortly.

By the central limit theorem, as $N\to\infty$, the resultant probability
distribution function (PDF) $p_\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{E})$ of $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$ is Rayleigh distributed and the
corresponding probability distribution function $p_I(I)$ of the intensity
$I(\mathbf{r})=|\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})|^2$ is an exponential
\begin{equation}
	p_I(I) = \frac{1}{2\sigma_I^2}\exp\left(-\frac{I}{2\sigma_I^2}\right).
	\label{eqn:propexp}
\end{equation}

Given that the $q$th moment of $p_I(I)$ is
\begin{align}
	\overline{I^q} & ={(2\sigma_I^2)}^q q!,
\end{align}
the mean is $\bar{I} = 2\sigma_I^2$ and the standard deviation of the intensity distribution is
\begin{align}
	\sigma_{\text{intensity}} & = \sqrt{\overline{I^2} - \bar{I}^2}         \\
	                          & = \sqrt{2(2\sigma_I^2)^2 - (2\sigma_I^2)^2} \\
	                          & = 2\sigma_I^2 = \bar{I}.
\end{align}
Thus, the standard deviation equals the mean.  \Equation{eqn:propexp} can then be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
	p_I(I) = \frac{1}{\bar{I}}\exp\left(-\frac{I}{\bar{I}}\right).
	\label{eqn:exppdf}
\end{equation}

As a convenient measure, the \textit{contrast} of speckle, $C$, is defined as
the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the intensity
\begin{equation}
	C=\frac{\sigma_{\text{intensity}}}{\bar{I}}\quad\text{(speckle contrast)}.
	\label{eqn:specklecontrast}
\end{equation}
The exponential PDF and unity contrast are often mentioned as the reason
for the discincitive ``speckled'' appearance of speckle~\cite{goodman2007speckle}.
