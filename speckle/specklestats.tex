We describe the process by which this comes to pass
as follows.  Consider a surface plasmon which is created by a focussed beam
in a prism coupled setup.  Without loss of generality, we define the center
of the focussed beam as the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system
$(0,0,0)$.  If the beam is incident in the $x$-$z$ plane, the plasmon will
have an initial phase of $\exp(\mi \ksp x)$.  For simplicity, we neglect
that a Gaussian beam will have small out of plane components.  As mentioned
in \Section{sec:coneexist}, surface roughness or other inhomogenities can
elastically scatter an SPP during propagation.  This changes the direction,
but not the magnitude, of the in-plane $k$-vector.  Upon re-radiation as a
photon, the phase to a point
$(x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime)$ in the far field is 
\begin{equation}
\exp\!\left(\mi k_0 \sqrt{ (x-x^\prime)^2 + (y-y^\prime)^2 + (z-z^\prime)^2}\right)
\end{equation}

Because $z=0$ is the plane of scattering, we can rewrite the contribution
to the field by a single SPP scattering event as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}\left(\theta,\phi\right)=\exp\!\big( \mi \ksp x  
+ \mi k_0 \sin\theta \left(x\cos\phi+y\sin\phi\right)
+ \varphi\big)
\label{eqn:sppsinglescattering}
\end{equation}
where we have used the far field approximation $z^\prime\to\infty$ and the
coordinates of the far field are $(\theta,\phi)$.  Furthermore, in
\Equation{eqn:sppsinglescattering} we have assumed single scattering; an
SPP is scattered only once during propagation.  We will relax this
assumption in \Section{sec:multiplescattering} when we consider multiple
scattering.

If we can assume that the $(x,y)$ coordinates from which an SPP is
re-radiated as a photon are randomly distributed, we can follow the
treatment of \name{Goodman}~\cite{goodman2007speckle} and assume that our
speckle is described by a random phasor sum.
Specifically, we assume the field at each detector position $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$
is due to the coherent linear superposition of $N$ random phasors
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n \me^{\mi \phi_n}
\label{eqn:phasorsum}
\end{equation}
where $a_n$ and $\phi_n$ is the amplitude and phase of the $n$th phasor.
Furthermore, $\phi$ is randomly distributed on the interval $(-\pi,\pi)$.
In reality, these conditions may be loosened by the physics of the actual
experiment, which we will describe in turn.

By the central limit theorem, as $N\to\infty$, the resultant probability
distribution $p_\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{E})$ of $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$ is Rayleigh distributed and the
corresponding probability distribution $p_I(I)$ of the intensity
$I(\mathbf{r})=|\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})|^2$ is an exponential
\begin{equation}
p_I(I) = \frac{1}{2\sigma_I^2}\exp\left(-\frac{I}{2\sigma_I^2}\right)
\label{eqn:propexp}
\end{equation}

Because the $q$th moment of $p_I(I)$ is given by 
\begin{align}
\bar{I}^q&=(2\sigma_I^2)^q q!\\
         &=\bar{I}^q q!
\end{align}
the standard deviation of is equal to the mean,
$\sigma_I=\bar{I}$.  \Equation{eqn:propexp} can then be rewritten
\begin{equation}
p_I(I) = \frac{1}{\bar{I}}\exp\left(-\frac{I}{\bar{I}}\right)
\label{eqn:exppdf}
\end{equation}
We define here the notion of the \textit{contrast} of speckle, $C$, as the
ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the intensity
\begin{equation}
C=\frac{\sigma_I}{\bar{I}}
\label{eqn:specklecontrast}
\end{equation}
The exponential PDF and unity contrast account for the discincitive
appearance of speckle.

Before looking at the PDF of the intensity of the experimental cone
speckle, we will study two edge cases to prepare us for some of the
observed behavior.  These cases are for
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item a small number of scatters, and 
\item a strong single scatterer.
\end{inparaenum}
