Together with the contrast~\cite{goodman1975dependence}, the mean size of a
speckle is an important figure of merit for a speckle pattern, being connected
to the underlying scattering microstructure (surface roughness) and, in the
present case, the SPP transport therein.

%The mean speckle size, as a very
%important parameter of the speckle pattern, is of great
%importance to practical applications, e.g.\, measurement of
%the roughness of surfaces [2], detection of the scattering
%center concentration in a biological fluid [3], the particle
%aggregation [4] or determination of the optical thickness and
%the particle size in the scattering media [5]. Nevertheless,
%this paper is focused on determining the mean speckle size
%influenced purely by the properties of the light beam.
As discussed earlier, a measurement of the speckle spot
size yields the transverse dimension of the coherent source
on the scattering surface.
Following \name{Goodman}~\cite{goodman1975statistical} and
\name{Dainty}~\cite{dainty1975laser}, the size of a speckle is defined in
terms of the area of the normalized autocovariance function of the speckle
intensity pattern, $c_I(\Delta x, \Delta y)$.  The normalized autocovariance
function is likewise defined in terms of the autocorrelation $\Gamma_I(\Delta
x, \Delta y)$ by 
\begin{equation}
c_I(\Delta x, \Delta y) = \frac{\Gamma_I(\Delta x, \Delta y) - \bar{I}^2}{\bar{I}^2},
\label{eqn:normxcov}
\end{equation}
and the autocorrelation is defined as
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_I(\Delta x, \Delta y) = \intinfty\intinfty I(x,y) \tilde{I}(x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y) \md x \md y.
\end{equation}
For computation on real images, the integral is replaced by a sum.  Taking
advantage of the Wienerâ€“Khinchin theorem, the autocorrelation is simply the
Fourier transform of the power spectral density, vis.
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_I(\Delta x, \Delta y) = \ff{|I(x,y)|^2}(\Delta x, \Delta y)
\end{equation}
and thus  $c_I(\Delta x, \Delta y)$ can be efficiently calculated on a
computer\footnote{For example in MATLAB this is implimented with
\texttt{xcov(I,'coeff')}}.

The expected autocovariance for a given specklegram is, via the diffraction
limit, the Fourier transform of geometry of the illuminated spot.  For a
circular spot, $c_I$ is given as a function of angle $\Delta \theta$ by
\begin{equation}
c_I\left(\Delta \theta\right) = 1 + \left(\frac{2 J_1(u)}{u}\right)^2;\quad
u=\frac{d\, \Delta\theta}{\lambda}.
\label{eqn:angularsize}
\end{equation}
Where $d$ is the diameter of the scattering spot and $\lambda$ is the
scattering wavelength.  Likewise, the area of a speckle is the integral over
$c_I$ in the appropriate coordinate system.  Discussion and analysis of the
experiment in this regrard is found in \Chapter{ch:scatteringmicro}.

\subsection{Experiment}\label{sec:specklesizeexpf}
To further investigate the nature of speckle in the cone, an experiment was
conducted using long-range surface plasmons excited in the Kretschmann ATR
geometry.  The incident Gaussian beam with wavelength $\lambda =
\SI{660}{\nano\meter}$ was focused on the hypotenuse of the prism using a
microscope objective attached to a zoom lens housing, as
Figures~\ref{fig:experimentalpicture} and~\ref{fig:experimentalsetup}.  To
prepare the scattering surface, \SI{57}{\nano\meter} citrate-capped spherical
gold nanoparticles at a concentration of \SI{0.0717}{\nano\Molar} were flowed
over the sensor for \SI{15}{\minute}, and then flushed with distilled
water.

Two imaging sensors were employed in the experiment.  The first was positioned
to capture a section of the cone and its embedded speckle.  The second was on
the inverted microscope and provided a rough estimate of the spot size of the
focused beam.

The angular size of the speckle was computed from the cone images using
\Equation{eqn:normxcov}, first converting the sensor coordinates from $I(x,y)$
to $I(\theta)$ as described in \Section{sec:spkline}.  An approximation of the
scattering spot size was also made by computing the $1/\me$ width for a
Gaussian fit to the averaged spot profile on the surface image taken by the
inverted microscope camera.  The results of the experiment are shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:spotsize} and~\ref{fig:spotsizewspeckle}.

\Figure{fig:spotsizewspeckle} shows an example of the raw data from which the
data for \Figure{fig:spotsize} was derived.  In the left column,
\Figure{fig:spotsizewspeckle} shows three example spot sizes measured at 102,
365, and \SI{599}{\micro\meter}.  To the right of each spot image is its
corresponding specklegram.  It is difficult to distinguish the difference in
speckle sizes between these images.

for three different example spot sizes.  Notice that the angular size of the
speckles is not significantly different in the three cases.}
\label{fig:spotsizewspeckle}
\end{figure}

In \Figure{fig:spotsize} the angular size of speckles was computed for spot
sizes in the range of 100 to \SI{450}{\micro\meter} by ensemble averaging the
normalized autocovariance function across different realizations of the same
speckle pattern at the same spot size.  Surprisingly, the results show a
speckle size which is independent of spot size within this range.  The
intersection of the theoretical prediction from \Equation{eqn:angularsize} and
the experimental data occurs at a spot size of \SI{250}{\micro\meter}.

\end{figure}

This phenomena is \textit{not} present when exciting conventional surface
plasmons in a similar setup (\Figure{fig:opticalsetup}), as evidenced in
\Figure{fig:threespecklesizes} for an Air-Ag-BK7 three-layer setup (see
\Section{sec:intexperimental}).  From left to right, each image shows the cone
with a progressively tighter focal spot: on the left, a defocused spot,
center, a tightly focused spot, and right, a spot focused on a single defect
producing a ring without speckle.  Although neither the actual spot size nor
the camera position was recorded in this particular experiment, the behavior
is clearly qualitatively described by \Equation{eqn:angularsize}; the size of
the speckle is inversely proportional to the spot size.

\Equation{eqn:angularsize} describes an inverse relationship between speckle
size and the size of the scattering spot which is in accord with the
approximation given by \name{Dainty}~\cite{dainty1975laser} of $\lambda z/d$.
