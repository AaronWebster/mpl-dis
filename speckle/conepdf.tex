The intensity PDF of the cone is shown in \Figure{fig:conepdf} for a single
speckle realization at an azimuthal angle of $\phi=\SI{90}{\degree}$.
Again, it is usually required to ensemble average over many different
realizations, but as shown useful statistics emerge for a single
realization when averaging over many speckles; the same strategy employed
in multispeckle diffusing wave spectroscopy~\cite{zakharov2006multispeckle}.

The observed PDF is well described by the Rayleigh distribution of
\Equation{eqn:exppdf}.  There is a small constant background, but this is
likely attributed to experimental noise or an imperfect background
subtraction in image processing.  The contrast is near unity, with a value
of $C=1.0637$.  Averaging over many speckle realizations we obtain the same
result of a near unity contrast.

The experimental intensity PDF and contrast fit very well with the
predictions of found using random phasor sums.
