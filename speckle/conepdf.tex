A PDF of the intensity in the cone is shown in \Figure{fig:conepdf} for a
single speckle realization in the cone.  Again, it is usually required to
ensemble average over many different speckle realizations, but we find
useful statistics emerge for a single realization when the observed area is
large.  The observed intensity is very well described by a Rayleigh
distribution (\Equation{eqn:exppdf}).  There is a small constant
background, but this is likely attributed to experimental noise or an
imperfect background subtraction in image processing.  The contrast is near
unity, with a value of $C=1.0637$.
