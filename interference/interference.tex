When SPPs are excited in a prism coupled setup using a focused beam, it is
possible to observe a spatial interference pattern in either the specular
or conically scattered light~\cite{webster2013interference}.  Surprisingly,
despite the popularity of SPR as a biosensing tool, the phenomena went
unreported until 2005~\cite{schumann2008near}~\cite{andaloro2005optical},
and has since then only been reported in a handful of limited
cases~\cite{shan2009measuring}~\cite{simon2007observation}.  An example of
the pattern in the cone is shown in \Figure{fig:coneintrofig} for a silver
film on high refractive index glass (LAH79) in air.  In the present chapter
it is shown that, in contradction to previous
explainations~\cite{schumann2008near}~\cite{andaloro2005optical}, the
presence of these oscillations indicates self-interference of the scattered
SPPs without any contributions from specular reflection.  

%In this chapter we study spatial evolution of these fields in the context
%of Fourier optics and discuss potential applications to increasing the
%resolution of based biosensing.

\section{Theory} \label{sec:interferencetheory}
For simplicity the problem is restricted to the $x$-$z$ plane.  Consider an
incident $p$-polarized Gaussian beam passing through a prism evanescently
exciting either normal or long range SPPs on a metal film.  On the film,
the Gaussian beam may be represented in $k$-space as $\tilde{g}(k_x)$,
where
\begin{align}
\tilde{g}(k_x) &= \frac{w_0}{\sqrt{2}} \exp\left(\frac{1}{4}w_0\left(k_x - \ksp\right)\right)\\
&= \intinfty g(x)\, \me^{\mi k_x x} \md x
\end{align}
and
\begin{equation}
g(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{w_0^2} + \mi \ksp x\right),
\end{equation}
where $w_0$ denotes the Gaussian beam waist parameter at the focus.  In the
specular direction, the field $\tilde{E}_\mathrm{notch}(k_x)$ is given by its
Fresnel reflectivity $\tilde{r}^p(k_x)$ multiplied by $\tilde{g}(k_x)$,
\begin{equation}
\tilde{E}_\mathrm{notch}(k_x)=\tilde{g}(k_x)\,\tilde{r}^p(k_x).
\end{equation}

Consider the spatial evolution of the light as it propagates
away from the surface.
The complete field in both $x$ and $z$ can be obtained by computing
the Fourier transform of $\tilde{E}_\mathrm{notch}(k_x)$ multiplied 
by a free space transfer function $\me^{\mi k_{z} z}$
\begin{align}
E_\mathrm{notch}(x,z) &= \intinfty \tilde{E}_\mathrm{notch}\, \me^{\mi k_{z,1} z}\, \me^{\mi k_x x} \md k_x\\
 &= \intinfty \tilde{g}(k_x)\, \tilde{r}^p(k_x)\, \me^{\mi \sqrt{k_0^2 \epsilon_1 - k_x^2}z}\, \me^{\mi k_x x} \md k_x
\label{eqn:fourier123}
\end{align}
Likewise, the conically scattered field may be found using the same
treatment yielding
\begin{align}
E_\text{cone}(x,z) = \intinfty \tilde{g}(k_x)\, 
\tilde{t}^p_+(k_x)\, \tilde{t}^p_-(k_x)\,\me^{\mi k_z z}\, \me^{\mi k_x x}
\md k_x.
\label{eqn:fourier321}
\end{align}
Though the integral seems to have no analytic solution, its evaluation is
nonetheless straightforward on a computer.  The same Fourier transform
recipe may be used to find fields in three dimensions, as was done in
\Section{sec:fresnelnearfar}.

\section{Experiment}
\begin{figure}[ht]

 \caption{Experimental setup.  Light from a laser passes

	focuses the light on to hypotenuse of the hemispherical prism.  Lens $f_4$ re-images the reflected
 field to a beam profiler where it is recorded.}
\label{fig:opticalsetup}
\end{figure}
Experimental verification of the predictions of \Equation{eqn:fourier123}
and \Equation{eqn:fourier321} was performed with the setup shown in
\Figure{fig:opticalsetup}.  Light from an
unpolarized \SI{30}{\milli\watt} \SI{632.8}{\nano\meter} helium-neon
laser first passes through the polarizing
beamsplitter BS.  It is then expanded and re-collimated by lenses $f_1$ and $f_2$ as an
approximately Gaussian beam with a $1/\me^2$ beam waist of
\SI{3}{\milli\meter} The light is steered by mirrors $m_1$ and $m_2$ to
lens $f_3$, antireflection coated aspherical lens with a focal length of
\SI{20}{\milli\meter}, which
focuses the light to the central point of the hypotenuse of a
\SI{10}{\milli\meter} diameter LAH79 hemispherical prism
($n(\SI{632.8}{\nano\meter})\approx1.98$).  The beam makes a central angle
of $\thetasp\approx\SI{32}{\degree}$ with the hypotenuse.
On the hypotenuse of the prism is a \SI{49.8}{\nano\meter} silver film
obtained through a sputtering process (See \Section{sec:expsputtering}.
The specific thickness was chosen to
optimizes the far field ATR minimum in the specularly reflected
direction.  Silver was used because it has the longest SPP propagation
length of all readily available sputtering targets.
Consistent with the Fourier optics perspective, a longer SPP propagation
length on the interface results in a narrower resonance linewidth in the
far field and vice versa.  An LAH79 hemispherical prism was used because of
its high refractive index ($n\approx 1.98$ at \SI{632.8}{\nano\meter}) and
because its hemispherical shape permits observation of scattered light with
minor distortion.  The totally internally reflected or scattered light is
optionally imaged at this point by the lens $f_4$, which is identical to
lens $f_3$.  The optical fields are observed by direct projection on a 10-bit
CCD sensor (beam profiler).  Since most of the interesting spatial structure of the
reflected beam occurs in a small spatial range, Lens $f_4$
is mounted on a micrometer stage.  As the stage is translated, different focal
planes can be imaged.

\label{fig:fresnelprop}
\end{figure}
Verification of the optical fields were obtained using a beam profiler for
an optimally focused lens $f_3$ while the focal plane of lens $f_4$ was moved normal
to the direction of radiation.  Images at increasing distances from the
surface were taken of light in both the notch
($\phi=0$) and the cone at an angle $\phi = \SI{90}{\degree}$.  Since the
cone is more or less radially isotropic, the choice of $\phi$ in this
experiment is arbitrary as long as it is far enough away from the incident
or specular beam.  The data is shown in \Figure{fig:fresnelprop} along with 
theoretical calculations based on \Equation{eqn:fourier123} and
\Equation{eqn:fourier321}. Linear (2D) sections of the experimentally obtained results for
three different characteristic propagation distances are also shown.  
The $z=\SI{10}{\micro\meter}$ and $z=\SI{100}{\milli\meter}$ distances
are representative of the near and far field; their optical fields 
related by a Fourier transform.  The intermediate propagation
distance $z=\SI{0.1}{\milli\meter}$ was chosen because of the high visibility of the oscillations.  As is evident from the figures, as the field propagates it
diffracts, exhibiting an evolving asymmetric oscillatory structure between
the near and far fields.  The experimentally obtained field matches well with
theoretical calculations using an unmodified Drude model for Ag.

At $z=0$, $|E_\text{notch}(x,z=0)|^2$ matches the near field theoretically
predicted via a similar method by \name{Chuang}~\cite{chuang1986lateral}, or through
vector Gaussian beam decomposition~\cite{baida1999theoretical}.  It has
also been experimentally verified through near field optical measurements
(SNOM), though this only permits observation of the field on the 2-3
interface, or $|E_\text{cone}(x,z=0)|^2$.  Near field measurements of the
1-2 interface are not possible due to the presence of the prism.  It is
interesting that both fields have been obtained using optical-only methods;
both SPP propagation and radiative decay are observed simultaneously.

The far field is often defined as as $z\gg 2 D^2/\lambda$, where $D$ is the
spatial width of the source.  For Ag at \SI{632.8}{\nano\meter}, the Drude
model permittivity is $\epsilon = \num{-16.858+0.437i}$ and the $1/\me$ SPP
propagation distance normal to the interface $D = 1/(2 k_x) \approx
\SI{60}{\micro\meter}$ and the resulting far field limit is $2 D^2/\lambda
\approx \SI{10}{\milli\meter}$.  This seems to be consistent with both the
simulated and experimental results, as it is approximately the distance in
\Figure{fig:fresnelprop} for which the oscillations disappear.

\subsection{Interference and Diffraction}
Previous reports of the oscillations in the specular direction for long
range surface plasmons~\cite{simon2007observation} and localized surface
plasmons~\cite{schumann2008near} have described it as arising due to
interference between the specular reflection of the Gaussian beam from the
1-2 interface and the re-radiated plasmon field from the 2-3 interface.
These components can be identified by the two peaks in the near field
specular signal.  While it is true that the field in the
specular direction contains both components, and that $\tilde{r}_{12}$ and
$\tilde{r}_{23}$ are indeed antiphase at $k_\text{sp}$ the asymmetric 
oscillatory pattern does not require a specular component to be observed.

\caption{Comparison of the propagated $\tilde{r}_{123}(k_x)$ verses
$(\tilde{r}_{123}(k_x)-\tilde{r}_{12})$.  Note that oscillations occur in
both cases.  }
\label{fig:r123m12}
\end{figure}

In \Figure{fig:r123m12}, the contribution of the 1-2 interface has been
removed by propagating $\tilde{r}_{123}-\tilde{r}_{12}$.  to
$z=\SI{1.17}{\milli\meter}$.  Note that the oscillations persist, despite
the absence of $\tilde{r}_{12}$.  In terms of the experiment, this is
equivalent to the profile found in the conically scattered light, itself
containing spatial oscillations.

In light of these observations, it is more correct to ascribe the
asymmetric oscillatory structure as being a diffraction, rather than a two
component interference phenomena motivated by phase alone.  It should be
noted that this can also be found in almost any causal function propagated
by a free space transfer term. As a paragon example, the Fourier
transformed Lorentzian absorption $\tilde{f}(k) = 1/(1+\mi k)$
qualitatively displays the phenomena of the conical radiation when
propagated.

%\subsection{Evanescent Solutions}
%In the context of diffraction integrals, the free space transfer function
%$\exp(\mi k_{z,1} z)$ is often concerned with evanescent and propagating
%terms, giving rise to the diffraction limit.  Here,
%$k_{z,1}=\sqrt{k_0^2 \epsilon_1 - k_x^2}$ is imaginary for $k_0^2
%\epsilon_1 < k_x^2$.  It is interesting to note that this never occurs.
%Ignoring the condition for total internal reflection, 
%$k_x = k_0 \sqrt{\epsilon_1} \sin \theta$ and we can set up an inequality
%\begin{align}
%k_0^2 \epsilon_1 &< k_x^2\\
%k_0^2 \epsilon_1 &< \left(k_0 \sqrt{\epsilon_1} \sin \theta\right)^2\\
%k_0^2 \epsilon_1 &< k_0^2 \epsilon_1 \sin^2 \theta\\
%1 &< \sin^2 \theta
%\end{align}
%which is false, suggesting that if all light is collected, no information is
%lost during propagation from the near to far field.

\section{The Fourier Optics Perspective}
There are several perspectives of SPR phenomena which can be insightful in
explaining why exactly the spatial oscillations are asymmetric.  The first
is an argument from causality.  Assume a complex function $\chi(\omega) =
\chi'(\omega) + \mi \chi''(\omega)$ whose real and imaginary parts are
related by Kramers-Kronig relations
\begin{align}
\chi(\omega)=\mi \hf{\chi(\omega)}
\end{align}
with 
\begin{align}
\chi'(\omega) &= \hf{\chi''(\omega)}\\
\chi''(\omega) &= -\hf{\chi'(\omega)}
\end{align}
where $\hf{\chi(\omega)}$ is the Hilbert transform of $\chi(\omega)$.
The Fourier transform of $\chi(\omega)$ is
\begin{align}
\chi(\omega) &= \chi'(\omega) + \mi \chi''(\omega)\\
\ff{\chi(\omega)} &= \ff{\chi'(\omega) + \mi \chi''(\omega)}\\
&= \ff{\chi'(\omega)} + \ff{\mi \chi''(\omega)}\\
&= \ff{\chi'(\omega)} + \ff{\mi \hf{\chi'(\omega)}} \\
&= \ff{\chi'(\omega)} + \sgn(\omega) \ff{\chi'(\omega)} \\
\end{align}
Or succinctly,
\begin{align}
\ff{\hf{\chi(\omega)}} = (-\mi \sgn(\omega)) \ff{\chi(\omega)}
\end{align}
In other words, the Fourier transform of any function which satisfies
Kramers-Kronig relations is ``one-sided'' as a necessary
condition of causality.  This is also true for the Fresnel
reflectivity as well as the complex permittivity.

The second perspective is couched in Fourier optics.  Here, because SPR
occurs at the focus of a Gaussian beam, it can be seen as a spatial filter
which modifies the local $k$-vectors to produce the resulting far field
optical pattern.  If the SPR resonance condition is sharp, the Fourier
integral (\Equation{eqn:fourier123}) is truncated and the discontinuity
acts as a low pass filter for light.  The asymmetric oscillations are then
essentially a manifestation of Gibb's phenomena.  This idea seems to be
well supported, because if the SPR resonance is broadened, say in the case
of a BK7-Au-\ce{H2O} system, the interference is greatly attenuated.
