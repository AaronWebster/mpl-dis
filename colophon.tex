This dissertation was typeset using \pdfTeX {\verb 3.1415926-2.5-1.40.14}. All
two dimensional plots were rendered using pgfplots with styles influenced by
Eduard Tufte~\cite{tufte1983visual}~\cite{tufte1983visual}. Colors were chosen
from datasets researched by Jan Brewer~\cite{harrower2003colorbrewer}.
Schematics and other line drawings were prepared using Inkscape. Writing done
in linux using vim.

The Monte Carlo simulations were written in \texttt{c} with pararallelism
accomplished using \texttt{mpi}. The vortex tracking and image processing
algorithms were written in \texttt{octave}. Parallell execution was done on the
woody cluster at the RRZE, Erlangen.
