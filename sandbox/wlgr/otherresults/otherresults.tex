The distribution of scatterers has little to no effect on the overall
structure.  It does, however have a (seemingly random) effect on the
intensity around the ring.

Harmonic analysis of the experimental weirdospace data was done for each
pixel row and each weirdospace image in order to search for standing wave
tertiary stripes.  A histogram of the resultant frequencies gives evidence
that a hidden signal exists in the data, even thought it not might be
visible to the naked eye.  This analysis was done a long time ago and I do
not trust it entirely.
