\subsection{Type \Rmnum{1} Events: Single Scattering Involving the Tip}
The most dominant features of weirdospace are known as {\it primary
    stripes}.  Primary stripes are thought to arise from single scattering off
the tip.  Consider the phase accumulation for this event type.  It consists
of only two terms: the local phase $\varphi_\mathrm{l,tip}$ sampled by the tip
position $(x_\mathrm{tip},y_\mathrm{tip})$, and the phase to the far field
$\varphi_\mathrm{ff,tip}$.  The intensity in weirdospace for primary stripes is
\begin{align}
  E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{1}}=
  A_\mathrm{\Rmnum{1}}\;
  e^{i(\varphi_\mathrm{l,tip}+\varphi_\mathrm{ff,tip})}
\end{align}
where an argument $a e^{i \Phi}$, representing is a fixed background phase required to
produce any structure at all is always assumed to be present.  As outlined in Bert's thesis, there is
excellent agreement between experiment and theory regarding the
mathematical description of this feature.

Observe Permutations \numrange{0}{7} in Figure \ref{fig:clevergridlinhsv}.  All of these include single
scattering off the tip and off of them exhibit primary stripes.  The
marginal exception is Permutation \num{5}, where primary stripes appear as
a phase rather than an intensity feature.  Nonetheless, primary stripes
appear in all permutations where single scattering off the tip is present, and
conversely are suppressed in all where it is not.

\subsection{Type \Rmnum{2} Events: Single Scattering not Involving the Tip}
Single scattering not involving the tip can be thought of as the
superposition of all single scattering events from all scatterers.
\begin{align}
  E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{2}}=
  \sum_{n=0}^{N}
  A_{\mathrm{\Rmnum{2}},n}\;
  e^{i(\varphi_{\mathrm{l},n}+\varphi_{\mathrm{ff},n})}
\end{align}
In the far field the superposition of many waves with phase terms
$\varphi_{\mathrm{l},n}$ and $\varphi_{\mathrm{ff},n}$, themselves
essentially uncorrelated and uniformly random tend to cancel each other out.
The result of this is a random fixed phase (white noise), shown singly in
Permutation \num{11}.

We can formally derive the intensity distribution for Type \Rmnum{2} events
as follows. The field $E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{2}}$ is a sum of $N$ independent
random phasors $a_n e^{i\phi_n}$ where the phases $\phi_n$ are uncorrelated
and uniformly distributed. By the Central Limit Theorem, for large $N$,
the real and imaginary components of the field approach independent Gaussian
distributions with zero mean. This can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
  E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{2}} = X + iY
\end{align}
where $X$ and $Y$ are independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean
and equal variance $\sigma^2$.

The resulting intensity $I = |E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{2}}|^2 = X^2 + Y^2$
therefore follows an Exponential distribution:
\begin{align}
  P(I) = \frac{1}{\langle I \rangle} e^{-I/\langle I \rangle}
\end{align}
where $\langle I \rangle = 2\sigma^2$ is the mean intensity. This result
is formally known as Rayleigh statistics for the amplitude, and the
intensity distribution is characteristic of {\it fully developed speckle},
a universal phenomenon in coherent wave propagation through random media.

\subsection{Type \Rmnum{3} Events: Multiple Scattering Involving the Tip}
This is where things get interesting.  Consider a multiply scattered path
involving the tip where the tip is {\bf not} the last scatterer.  The phase
to the far field $\varphi_\mathrm{ff}$ is determined by the superposition
of all the randomly placed scatterers, so it should behave like the phase
from a Type \Rmnum{2} event -- an essentially constant background.  The
local phase consists of many multiply scattered paths involving the tip,
the result of which is like adding a constant to the phase of the tip -- the
phase from all the paths not involving the tip average out and all you get
is the local tip phase.  This manifests itself in weirdospace as a fixed
background at the plasmon frequency (the ``horizontal bars'') as a wave of
the form
\begin{align}
  E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{3}a}= A_\mathrm{\Rmnum{3}a}\;e^{i(k_\mathrm{sp}x)}
\end{align}
This can easily be seen in the \SI{180}{\degree} scattering direction for
all permutations which include multiple scattering involving the tip.
Also, note that only in cases where multiple scattering involving the tip
has been suppressed does this kind of background disappear.

Again, here I haven't reached the result analytically, but numerical
estimates confirm that, say for an infinite sum of cosines and a random
variable $p_n$
\begin{align}
  \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{N}\frac{\cos(r+p_n)}{N}=\cos(r+\vartheta)
\end{align}
where $\vartheta$ is a fixed phase.

Next, consider a multiply scattered path involving the tip where the tip is
the last scatterer.  The statistical result is similar to that of the
previous case, but here the local phase becomes a constant fixed phase and
the phase to the far field is all which is preserved.  This manifests
itself as a set of stripes of fixed wavelength, making a complete rotation
every rotation around the ring.
\begin{align}
  E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{3}b}=
  A_\mathrm{\Rmnum{3}b}\;
  e^{i k_\mathrm{sp}\left(x_n\cos\phi+y_n\sin\phi\right)}
\end{align}
At \num{0} and $\pi\;\si{\rad}$ these are indistinguishable from the previous
case, and orthogonal at $\pi/2$ and $3\pi/4 \;\si{\rad}$.
It should be noted here that if the path involved the tip twice where the
tip occurs in both the local phase and the phase to the far field, this is
identical to a Type \Rmnum{1} event.

The combination of the two Type \Rmnum{3} events with the Type \Rmnum{1}
and \Rmnum{2} events explain much of the structure around the ring, as are
shown in the figures in the Appendix.

\subsection{Type \Rmnum{4} Events: Multiple Scattering Not Involving the Tip}
Somewhat anticlimactically, this results in another fixed background.  Both
the local phase and the phase to the far field are determined statistically
from the group as a whole in the same way as Type \Rmnum{2} events.

\subsection{Coherent Backscattering\\{\normalsize or}\\

\\{\normalsize or}\\
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
Since coherent backscattering (CBS) is a general multiple scattering
phenomenon, it was though that it would be seen in the experimental
weirdospace data - manifest as so called {\it secondary stripes}.  This
would be a wave identical to that of single scattering off the tip, but
excited by an evanescent field traveling in the opposite direction,
$\varphi_{\mathrm{l}}\to-\varphi_{\mathrm{l}}$.
\begin{align}
  E_\mathrm{\chi}=A_\chi\;e^{i (-\varphi_{\mathrm{l}}+\varphi_{\mathrm{ff}})}
  \label{eqn:cbs}
\end{align}
In Bert's thesis, the idea that secondary stripes were connected to CBS was
rejected based on analysis of the experimental data showing secondary
stripes were at the wrong angle.  I intend here to give evidence to the
contrary.

Figure \ref{fig:bertsdata1} shows the analytically predicted orientation of
secondary stripes along with the best fit orientation of such
stripes to an experimental weirdospace image for a particular angle along
the ring.

    orientation of secondary stripes and to the right, the best fit from the
    experimentally measured orientation.}
  \label{fig:bertsdata1}
\end{figure}
If you look carefully, you'll notice something strange about the figure:
the secondary stripes almost perfectly ``line up''.  While the phase
averaging over many scattering configurations may suppress interference
cross-terms away from the backscattering cone, the phenomenon is
fundamentally coherent rather than incoherent. The correct description
requires coherent superposition:
\begin{align}
  I_\mathrm{total} = \left|A_\mathrm{\Rmnum{1}} E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{1}} + A_\chi E_\chi \right|^2
\end{align}
where the amplitudes $A_\mathrm{\Rmnum{1}}$ and $A_\chi$ are determined by
the respective scattering strengths, rather than an incoherent sum of
intensities $|E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{1}}|^2 + |E_\chi|^2$.

This is detailed in Figure \ref{fig:sumsq}.  Here we show the approximate
orientation of primary and secondary stripes for the experimental data in
question along with the resultant sum of squares and square of sums.  In
this image, the difference between the two is marginal.  Indeed, a priori
interpretation of the images would not lead one to think they were anything
but inconsistent with the experiment.  However, by adjusting the relative
amplitudes of these waves as in Figure \ref{fig:increaseintensity},
assuming $E_\chi$ to be much less than $E_\mathrm{\Rmnum{1}}$, the analytic result
comes to match the experiment nearly perfectly.

The fitting coefficients found in Figure \ref{fig:increaseintensity}
($A_\mathrm{\Rmnum{1}} = 2.44$ versus $A_\chi = 0.23$) have a clear physical
interpretation: this amplitude ratio of approximately $10:1$ reflects the
ratio of the large scattering cross-section of the STM tip
($\sigma_\mathrm{tip}$) versus the much smaller scattering cross-section of
surface roughness features ($\sigma_\mathrm{surf}$). The tip, being a
large, well-defined scatterer with high polarizability, naturally produces
a much stronger scattering signal than the small-scale surface roughness
that contributes to the coherent backscattering signal.

There are many more examples of secondary stripes and their relation to
experiment in the Appendix.

We've actually seen this before in the Monte Carlo simulations, but didn't
know what to make of it without an explanation of the weirdospace features
caused my multiple scattering.  Figure \ref{fig:rtr} shows the difference
between analytic, with $E_\chi$ removed, and Monte Carlo simulations with
time reverse paths removed.  The results are almost exactly what one would
expect if secondary stripes were truly a coherent backscattering
phenomenon.  Amazing.
