The single metal-dielectric interface is the principle under which most
labratory and commercial SPR biosensors operate.  Apart from this, certain
multilayer interface geometries, such as the one shown in
\Figure{fig:multilayergeo}, have attractive features relevant to the
present work.  In particular, it will be shown that multilayer interface
geometries support SPP propagation lengths more than order of magnitude
greater than the single layer interface.  For example, symmetric multilayer
interface with \SI{10}{\nano\meter} gold layers at \SI{632.8}{\nano\meter}
see ehancements of $10$-$60$, with propagation lengths up to
\SI{250}{\micro\meter}~\cite{kuwamura1983experimental}~\cite{craig1983experimental}.

For layers $D_1$ and $D_3$, the equations are the same as for the single layer system
\begin{align}
\left.\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{H}_1(x,z,t) &=
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\
H_{y,1}\\
0
\end{pmatrix} \me^{\mi(k_{x,1}x+k_{z,1}z-\omega t)}\\
\mathbf{E}_1(x,z,t) &=
\begin{pmatrix}
E_{x,1}\\
0\\
E_{z,1}\\
\end{pmatrix} \me^{\mi(k_{x,1}x+k_{z,1}z-\omega t)}
\end{aligned}
\right\}& \quad D_1\label{eqn:lrsppplanewavedielectric}\\
\left.\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{H}_3(x,z,t) &=
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\
H_{y,3}\\
0
\end{pmatrix}
\me^{\mi(k_{x,3}x+k_{z,3}z-\omega t)}\\
\mathbf{E}_3(x,z,t) &=
\begin{pmatrix}
E_{x,3}\\
0\\
E_{z,3}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\me^{\mi(k_{x,3}x+k_{z,3}z-\omega t)}
\end{aligned} 
\right\}&\quad D_3.
\label{eqn:lrsppplanewavemetal}
\end{align}

If the half-thickness of $D_2$, $a$, is sufficiently small, $D_2$ will act
as a waveguide for SPPs.  In $D_2$ there are two interfaces, the
$D_2$-$D_1$ interface at $+a$ and the $D_2$-$D_3$ interface at $-a$,
leading to
\begin{align}
\mathbf{H}_2(x,z,t) &=
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\
H^+_{y,2}\\
0
\end{pmatrix} \me^{\mi(k_{x,2}x+k_{z,2}z-\omega t)}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\
H^-_{y,2}\\
0
\end{pmatrix} \me^{\mi(k_{x,2}x-k_{z,2}z-\omega t)} \label{eqn:multihhx} \\
\mathbf{E}_2(x,z,t) &=
\begin{pmatrix}
\mi E^+_{x,2}\\
0\\
E^+_{z,2}\\
\end{pmatrix} \me^{\mi(k_{x,2}x+k_{z,2}z-\omega t)}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
\mi E^-_{x,2}\\
0\\
E^-_{z,2}\\
\end{pmatrix} \me^{\mi(k_{x,2}x-k_{z,2}z-\omega t)}.
\label{eqn:multieex}
\end{align}

Taking Equations~\ref{eqn:multihhx} and~\ref{eqn:multieex} and applying
continuity of $H_y$ and $E_x$ at the boundaries, the dispersion relation is
expressed as
\begin{equation}
\me^{-4 \mi k_{x,1} a} = 
\frac{k_{x,1}/\epsilon_1 + k_{x,2}/\epsilon_2}
     {k_{x,1}/\epsilon_1 - k_{x,2}/\epsilon_2}
\frac{k_{x,1}/\epsilon_1 + k_{x,3}/\epsilon_3}
     {k_{x,1}/\epsilon_1 - k_{x,3}/\epsilon_3}.
\label{eqn:lrsppdispersion}
\end{equation}

\Equation{eqn:lrsppdispersion} is transcendental, but can still be
visualized by plotting the difference between the left hand side (lhs) and
right hand side (rhs) of the equation, 
$\log\left(\Re\left(|\mathrm{rhs}-\mathrm{lhs}|\right)\right)$.  The result
is plotted in \Figure{fig:lrsppdispersionrelation}, with the negative
values representing regions where SPP modes are supported.

\subsection{Photonic Crystal Structures}
The layer systems in Figures~\ref{fig:singleinterfacegeo}
and~\ref{fig:multilayergeo} represent by far the most popular layer
configurations for SPR biosensing.  There is, however, a very intriguing
geometry based on a multilayer stack with which one can obtain SPP
propagation lengths in the \textit{millimeter} range.  A typical three
layer system in the Kretschmann ATR configuration will exhibit SPP
propagation lengths on the order of \SI{8}{\micro\meter} for gold.  The
symmetric configuration has been experimentally reported to increase the
propagation length by a factor of
$10$-$60$~\cite{kuwamura1983experimental}~\cite{craig1983experimental}, and
the photonic crystal structure has been reported to further increase the
propagation length by a factor of 100~\cite{konopsky2009long}.

Currently, much of the work on photonic crystal structures is being carried
out by \name{Konopsky}~\cite{konopsky2006long}~\cite{konopsky2009long}.
The working principle is akin to a Bragg mirror; a one dimensional stack of
layers with varying refractive index is built up on the surface of a prism,
ultimately depositing a metal as the final layer.  The multilayer stack
works to minimize the tangential component of the electric field in the
metal, reducing SPP attenuation.  Reduction of SPP attenuation has several
advantages to ATR configurations; specifically, it is possible to use lossy metals with
more interesting surface chemistries (Pd and Pt), and it becomes possible
to study long range surface plasmons with near field probes, which the
liquid phase would otherwise make difficult.
