Having shown the existence of SPPs under the momentum-matching conditions of
Equations~\ref{eqn:sprcondition} and \ref{eqn:lrsppdispersion}, it is now
pertinent to predict how excitation of SPPs would manifest in an
experiment.  To do this, the Fresnel equations are used to calculate
the coupling conditions and properties of the excited field and the
profiles of the reflected, transmitted, and scattered optical fields.  

%We begin this section with our strategy for efficient computation of the
%Fresnel relations, and follow with a discussion of its predictions for both
%the near and far optical fields.  For implementation of this method on a
%computer, see the note on the Abeles matrix formalism in
%\Chapter{ch:abeles}.

\subsection{Prism Coupled Excitation}
According to the dispersion relation, \Equation{eqn:dispersion1}, 
SPPs will be excited on a
metal-dielectric interface if an optical field is incident at an angle 
$ck/\sqrt{\epsilon} \to ck\sin\theta/\sqrt{\epsilon}$.  Furthermore, the following
conditions must also be true:
\begin{enumerate}
\item SPPs will be excited with evanescent waves.  The
incident light must be at an angle greater than the critical angle, i.e.
$\theta>\arcsin\left(n_1/n_2\right)$.
\item The metal layer must
\begin{enumerate}
\item be thin enough to be at least partially optically transparent at the excitation wavelength
\item have small enough damping, set by its permittivity, so that SPPs can propagate
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}
Let us discuss these first in terms of the single interface system
first shown in \Figure{fig:prismcoupledsetups}.  We modify this system by
adding another layer, $D_3$, as shown in
\Figure{fig:prismcoupledsetups}(a).  In this system, light is incident from
$D_1$ and $\epsilon_1>\epsilon_3$, both satisfying
$\epsilon^\prime_1>\epsilon^\prime_3>1$ as per the first constraint.  $D_2$
is a metal.  Since the real part of the metal permittivity,
$\epsilon_2^\prime$, is a measure of its ability to store energy, and the
imaginary part, $\epsilon_2^{\prime\prime}$, a measure of its dissipation,
we are looking for a metal with a large negative real part and a small
imaginary part.  In this spirit, \Table{tbl:epsmetal600} shows the complex
permittivity for several metals at $\lambda=\SI{660}{\nano\meter}$.

\end{table}

From \Table{tbl:epsmetal600} it is easy to filter out an appropriate
choice: silver, gold, or copper, with silver having the lowest loss.  At
this point we choose gold and restrict our parameter space to this metal.
It has the second lowest loss, does not oxidize, and most importantly has
the most compatibility with existing biochemistry.  Furthermore, we find
via the Fresnel equations for such a three layer system that the thickness
of the metal layer must be below \SI{100}{\nano\meter}.  The multilayer
system is also modified as in \Figure{fig:prismcoupledsetups}(b), with the
prism being a supporting layer $\epsilon_0$ such that
$\epsilon^\prime_0>\epsilon^\prime_{1,3}>1$.  We also assume that
$\epsilon_1=\epsilon_3$ and that $\epsilon_2$ is gold.

Simultaneous optimization of all of these parameters, including the
incident angle was performed using nonlinear
minimization~\cite{brent1973algorithms}, on the notch depth.  For
$\epsilon_2$ gold and $\epsilon_3$ water, the three layer system predicts
optimum coupling around \SI{50}{\nano\meter} metal thickness, and
\SI{16}{\nano\meter} for the four layer system.  This is shown graphically
in \Figure{fig:fresnelangle} for different excitation wavelengths and
coupling angles.  In particular, note the broad range of conditions for
which SPP excitation is possible (though not necessarily optimal).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Near and Far Fields} \label{sec:fresnelnearfar}
We now use the Fresnel equations to predict optical fields taking into
account effects from SPP propagation.  Computation of the far field is
straightforward, as the Fresnel equations already provide an angular
spectrum.  The near field is found by taking advantage of the shift theorem
using the standard Fourier transform recipe
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \intinfty \tilde{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbf{k})
\,\me^{\mi \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{z}^\prime}
\,\me^{\mi \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}\md \mathbf{k}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbf{k})$ is the $k$-space electric field
found using the Fresnel equations, taking into account the distribution of
the incident field, and $\exp(\mi \mathbf{k} \cdot
\mathbf{z}^\prime)$ is the free-space transfer function along the 
propagation direction $\mathbf{z}^\prime$ which includes the evanescent
wave due to the domain of integration.  The mathematical details of this procedure
will be elaborated in \Section{sec:interferencetheory}, and the
computational details in \Section{sec:mrfsim}.

Plots of the incident, reflected, and near field intensities are shown in
\Figure{fig:fresnelnearfieldspp} for the three layer structure, which we
will call ``conventional SPPs'', and in \Figure{fig:fresnelnearfieldlrspp}
for the four layer structure, which we will call ``long range SPPs''
(LRSPPs).  This terminology will shortly become clear.  Both were excited
at \SI{660}{\nano\meter} with a Gaussian beam of numerical aperture
$\mathrm{NA}=0.2$.  The important features of these plots are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item As might be inferred from \Figure{fig:fresnelangle},
the most prominent feature of SPP excitation is a minimum, or ``notch'' in
the specularly reflected light at an angle $\thetasp$.  The angular
location of this minimum is highly sensitive to the refractive index in
which the SPP propagates; this is the mechanism most commonly exploited for
biosensing.  The notch can always be found close to the critical
angle for total internal reflection, with sharper resonances being closer
than broader ones (see \Appendix{ch:reference}).
\item Owing to their greater attenuation, excitation of conventional SPPs
displays a relatively broader notch compared with long range SPPs.
\item In the near field $x$-$y$ plots, both show the diffraction limited
focal spot at the origin as a small \SI{3x5}{\micro\meter} ellipse, with
SPPs propagating along the metal interface in the positive $x$ direction.
It can be seen that the LRSPP propagation distance is nearly 10 times that
of conventional SPPs.  This isn't necessarily a comment on the system's
refractive index sensitivity, though we will use this property to explore
single and multiple scattering effects in \Chapter{ch:scatteringmicro}.
