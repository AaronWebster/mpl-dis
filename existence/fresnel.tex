We have shown that SPPs can exist under certain momentum-matching
conditions layed out in Equations \ref{eqn:sprcondition} and
\ref{eqn:lrsppdispersion}.  We move now to predictions of what SPP
excitation actually looks like in an experiment.  To this accord, we will
use the Fresnel equations to calculate the coupling conditions and
properties of the excited field and the profiles of the reflected,
transmitted, and scattered optical fields.   We begin this section with our
strategy for efficient computation of the Fresnel relations, and follow
with a discussion of its predictions for both the near and far optical
fields. 

\subsection{Matrix Formalism}
The Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficents $r$ and $t$ for $s$
(transverse-electric) and $p$ (transverse-magnetic) polarization and a
single ($i$-$j$) interface are derived from the wave equation and are given
by
\begin{align}
r^s &= \frac{k_{z,i}-k_{z,j}}{k_{z,i}+k_{z,j}}\\
r^p &= \frac{\epsilon_i k_{z,j} - \epsilon_j k_{z,k}}{\epsilon_i k_{z,j} + \epsilon_j k_{z,k}} \\
t^s &= \frac{2 k_{z,i}}{k_{z,i}+k_{z,j}}\\
t^p &= \frac{2 \epsilon_i \epsilon_j k_{z,i}}{\epsilon_i k_{z,j} + \epsilon_j k_{z,i}}\\
\end{align}
where the superscript denotes the polarization.
Note that $k_{z}$ can be equivalently expressed either as a
function of incident angle $\theta$ or $k_x$
\begin{align}
 k_{z,i} &= k_0 \sqrt{\epsilon_i - \epsilon_{i-1} \sin \theta}\\
&= \sqrt{k_0^2\epsilon_i - k_x^2}
\end{align}
For multilayer systems, these equations can be applied recursively. In 
this work we use the much more computationally efficent 
Abeles matrix formalism.  Here, the $n$th system matrix for $s$ and $p$
polarization, $C^s_n$ and $C^p_n$, are
\begin{align}
C^s_n = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
\me^{-\mi k_{z,n} d_n} & r^s_{n,n+1} \me^{-\mi k_{z,n} d_n} \\
r^s_{n,n+1} \me^{\mi k_{z,n} d_n} & \me^{\mi k_{z,n} d_n} 
\end{array}\right)\\
C^p_n = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
\me^{-\mi k_{z,n} d_n} & r^p_{n,n+1} \me^{-\mi k_{z,n} d_n} \\
r^p_{n,n+1} \me^{\mi k_{z,n} d_n} & \me^{\mi k_{z,n} d_n} 
\end{array}\right)
\end{align}
where $n$ and $n+1$ are the layer indicies for a single interface.  A
matrix is constructed for each layer of the system and the resultant matrix
found as the product of these matricies
\begin{align}
M^s=\prod_n C^s_n\\
M^p=\prod_n C^p_n
\end{align}

From this matrix the system Fresnel coefficents are determined viz.
\begin{align}
r^p = \frac{M^p_{21}}{M^p_{11}}\\
r^s = \frac{M^s_{21}}{M^s_{11}}\\
t^p = \frac{1}{M^p_{11}}\\
t^s = \frac{1}{M^s_{11}}\\
\end{align}
where the subscripts identify the matrix elements.

\subsection{Prism Coupled Excitation}
From the information in the dispersion relation, SPP excitation at a
metal-dielectric interface is possible if we are incident at an angle such
that the light line moves from $ck/\sqrt{\epsilon}$ to
$ck\sin\theta/\sqrt{\epsilon}$.  Furthermore, we observe the following
conditions must also hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item SPP excitation will be accomplished with evanescent waves.  The
incident light must be at an angle greater than the critical angle, i.e.
$\theta>\arcsin\left(n_1/n_2\right)$.
\item The metal layer must
\begin{enumerate}
\item be thin enough to be at least partially optically transparent at the excitation wavelength
\item have small enough damping, set by its permittivity, so that SPPs can propagate
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Let us discuss these first in terms of the single interface system, as
first shown in \Figure{fig:prismcoupledsetups}.  We modify this system with
another layer, $\epsilon_3$, as shown in
\Figure{fig:prismcoupledsetups}(a).  In this system, light is incident from
$\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_1>\epsilon_3$, with both satisfying
$\epsilon^\prime_1>\epsilon^\prime_3>1$ as per the first constraint.
$\epsilon_2$ is a metal.  Since the real part of the metals permittivity
$\epsilon^\prime$ is a measure of its ability to store energy, and the
imaginary part $\epsilon^{\prime\prime}$ a measure of its dissipation, we
are looking for a metal with a large (negative) real part and a small
imaginary part.  \Table{tbl:epsmetal600} shows the complex permittivity for
several metals at $\lambda=\SI{660}{\nano\meter}$.

\label{tbl:epsmetal600}
\end{table}

From \Table{tbl:epsmetal600} it is easy to filter out an appropriate
choice: silver, gold, or copper, with silver having the lowest loss.  At
this point we choose gold and restrict our parameter space to this metal.
It has the second lowest loss, does not oxidize, and most importantly has
the most compatability with existing biochemistry.  Furthermore, we find
via the Fresnel equations for such a three layer system that the thickness
of the metal layer must be below \SI{100}{\nano\meter}.  The multilayer
system is also modified as in \Figure{fig:prismcoupledsetups}(b), with the
prism being a supporting layer $\epsilon_0$ such that
$\epsilon^\prime_0>\epsilon^\prime_{1,3}>1$.  We also assume that
$\epsilon_1=\epsilon_3$ and that $\epsilon_2$ is gold.

Simultaneous optimization of all of these parameters is a task best suited
for a computer.  For $\epsilon_2$ gold and $\epsilon_3$ water, the three
layer system predicts optimum coupling around \SI{50}{\nano\meter} metal
thickness, and \SI{16}{\nano\meter} for the four layer system.  The
coupling angle must be optimized this way as well.  This is shown
graphically in \Figure{fig:fresnelangle} for different excitation
wavelengths and coupling angles.  In particular, note the broad range of
conditions for which SPP excitation is possible.

excitation wavelength for normal (right) and long range (left) SPP structures in a Kretschmann ATR 
configuration.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Near Field}
The Fresnel equations may also be used to predict the near field intensity,
including effects from SPP propagation.  This is accomplished by taking
advantage of the shift theorem using the standard Fourier transform recipe
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \intinfty \tilde{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbf{k})
\,\me^{\mi \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{z}^\prime}
\,\me^{\mi \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}\md \mathbf{k}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbf{k})$ is the $k$-space electric field
found using the Fresnel equations, taking into account the distribution of
the incident field, and $\exp(\mi \mathbf{k} \cdot
\mathbf{z}^\prime$ is the free-space transfer function along the 
propagation direction $\mathbf{z}^\prime$.  The details of this procedure
will be elaborated in \Section{sec:interferencetheory}.  

Plots of the incident, reflected, and near field intensities are shown in
\Figure{fig:fresnellrsppfig} for both long range and conventional SPPs.
