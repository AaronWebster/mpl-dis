The dark band or notch in the specular direction is perhaps the most
classic signature of SPR in the Kretchmann ATR setup.  Fundamentally this
is due to the interference between the specularly reflected beam and the
re-radiated SPP field which is antiphase at $\theta_\mathrm{SP}$.  There
is, however, an additional important signature which can be observed in the
same half-space.  During propagation, surface roughness or other
inhomogenities in the metal surface can change the in-plane momentum of an
SPP such that for initial and resultant $k$-vectors $\mathbf{k}_a$ and
$\mathbf{k}_b$, $\mathbf{k}_a = (k_x,0,k_z) \to \mathbf{k}_b =
(k_x,k_y,k_z)$ and $\mathbf{k}_a\cdot\mathbf{k}_a =
\mathbf{k}_b\cdot\mathbf{k}_b$.  The plasmon is elastically scattered in
the plane of propagation.  This is also known as ``directional
scattering'', the signature of which is a annular cone of light at
$\theta_\mathrm{SP}$ along the azimuthal coordinate $\phi$.

The angular profile of the cone results from two processes.  First, light
permeates the metal film, which is identified by the Fresnel transmission
coefficent $t^p_+$, where ``$+$'' denotes the \textit{forward}
transmission, from the prism to the metal film.  The SPP is then
re-radiated through the film to the prism, which we identify by the Fresnel
\textit{reverse} transmission $t^p_-$.  The field in the cone

\begin{equation}
|E_\mathrm{cone}|^2 \propto	|t^p_+|^2 |t^p_-|^2
\end{equation}

In this aspect the Fresnel equations do not
