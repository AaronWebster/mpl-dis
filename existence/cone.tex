The dark band or notch in the specular direction is perhaps the most
classic signature of SPR in the Kretchmann ATR setup.  Fundamentally this
is due to the interference between the specularly reflected beam and the
re-radiated SPP field which is antiphase at $\theta_\mathrm{SP}$.  There
is, however, an additional important signature which can be observed in the
same half-space.  During propagation, roughness or other surface
inhomogenities can elastically modify the in-plane momentum of an SPP.
This is known as ``directional scattering'', the signature of which is a
annular cone of light at $\theta_\mathrm{SP}$ along an azimuthal coordinate
$\phi$.  The coordinates of this light and its relationship to the specular
notch are depicted in \Figure{fig:conefig}.  Note that in the subsequent
discussions, we will use the term ``cone'' when refering to light scattered
into the cone, and ``notch'' when refering to light in the specular
direction.

 \label{fig:conefig}
\end{figure}

Physically, light first transmits the prism and permeates the metal film,
exciting SPPs.  We identifiy this by the Fresnel \textit{forward}
transmission coefficent, $t^p_+$ (e.g. for a three layer system with layers
0, 1, and 2, $t^p_+ \equiv t^p_{012}$).  Upon re-radiation as a photon, the
light will take this path in reverse, which we identify by the Fresnel
\textit{reverse} transmission, $t^p_-$ (e.g. $t^p_- \equiv t^p_{210}$).  We
define intensity in the cone $I_\mathrm{cone}$ is proportional to the
product of these two~\cite{simon1976directional}.
\begin{equation}
I_\mathrm{cone} 
= \frac{1}{I_0}\frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d}\Omega} 
= 4 \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^4 |t^p_+|^2
|t^p_-|^2\,W(\theta_i,\theta_s,\phi)\, |s(\Delta \mathbf{k})|^2
\label{eqn:guhacone}
\end{equation}
where $I_0$ is the incident power, $\mathrm{d}I/\mathrm{d}\Omega$ is the
scattered power per solid angle, $s(\Delta \mathbf{k})$ is the surface
roughness spectrum, and $W(\theta_i,\theta_s,\phi)$ \textit{describes the
								interference of the two roughness induced current components in the
plane of incidence}.

\begin{equation}
|s(\Delta \mathbf{k})|^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{4\pi} \left<S^2\right>
\me^{-(\Delta k^2 \sigma^2)/4}
\label{eqn:surfaceroughness}
\end{equation}

Whatever, some roughness stuff, I just say the following:
\begin{equation}
|E_\mathrm{cone}|^2 \propto	|t^p_+|^2 |t^p_-|^2
\label{eqn:conefield}
\end{equation}

Due to the double enhancement factor in \Equation{eqn:guhacone}, light in
the cone has a narrower linewidth than its specular counterpart in the
notch.  In \Figure{fig:conevsnotch} we show a simulated provfile of the
normalized and inverted cone vs notch for a three layer system
($n_1=1.5142$, $n_2=\num{0.2843 + 3.3825i}$, $n_3=1.331$ and
$d_2=\SI{45}{\nano\meter}$).  This aspect causes certain measurements in
the cone to be more sensitive than those in the notch, an aspect we will
visit in \Chapter{ch:bulkri}.

Finally, something about speckle and how we'll talk about it later.
