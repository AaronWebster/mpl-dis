The dark band or notch in the specular direction is perhaps the most
classic signature of SPR in the Kretchmann ATR setup.  Fundamentally this
is due to the interference between the specularly reflected beam and the
re-radiated SPP field which is antiphase at $\theta_\mathrm{SP}$.  There
is, however, an additional important signature which can be observed in the
same half-space.  During propagation, roughness or other surface
inhomogenities can elastically modify the in-plane momentum of an SPP.
This is known as ``directional scattering'', the signature of which is a
annular cone of light at $\theta_\mathrm{SP}$ along an azimuthal coordinate
$\phi$.  The coordinates of this light and its relationship to the specular
notch are depicted in \Figure{fig:conefig}.  Note that in the subsequent
discussions, we will use the term ``cone'' when refering to light scattered
into the cone, and ``notch'' when refering to light in the specular
direction.

Physically, an SPP first is transmitted from the prism and permeates the
metal film.  We identifiy this by the Fresnel forward transmission
coefficent, $t^p_+$.  Upon re-radiation as a photon, the SPP will take this
path in reverse, which we identify by the Fresnel reverse transmission,
$t^p_-$.  The field in the cone $E_\mathrm{cone}$ is proportional to the
product of these two.
\begin{equation}
|E_\mathrm{cone}|^2 \propto	|t^p_+|^2 |t^p_-|^2
\end{equation}

In this aspect the Fresnel equations do not
