The signature of surface plasmon resonance in a prism coupled setup is the
notch in the specular direction, which can be thought of as arising from
interference between the specularly reflected beam and the re-radiated SPP
field anti-phase at $\thetasp$.  There is is, however, an additional
important signature which can be observed in the same half-space.

As observed in SPOM experiments with near field probes, during propagation
roughness or other surface inhomogeneities can elastically modify the
in-plane momentum of an SPP\@.  This phenomena is known as ``directional
scattering'', the signature of which is a annular ``cone'' of light at
$\thetasp$ along an azimuthal coordinate $\phi$ (\Figure{fig:conefig}).
Though light in the cone is far less intense than in the specular
direction, with even a \SI{5}{\milli\watt} HeNe laser it is bright enough
to be observed with the naked eye or recorded using an image sensor.

The physical process describing light in the cone proceeds as follows:
light first transmits the prism and permeates the metal film, exciting
SPPs.  The first transmission is identified by the Fresnel \textit{forward}
transmission coefficient, $t^p_+$ (e.g.\ for a three layer system with
layers 0, 1, and 2, $t^p_+ \equiv t^p_{012}$).  Upon SPP re-radiation as a
photon, light will take the transmitted path in reverse, which is
identified by the Fresnel \textit{reverse} transmission, $t^p_-$ (e.g.
$t^p_- \equiv t^p_{210}$).  The intensity in the cone $I_\mathrm{cone}$ is
proportional to the product of these two~\cite{simon1976directional}.
\begin{equation}
I_\mathrm{cone} 
= \frac{1}{I_0}\frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d}\Omega} 
= 4 {\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)}^4 |t^p_+|^2
|t^p_-|^2\,W(\theta_i,\theta_s,\phi)\, |s(\Delta \mathbf{k})|^2
\label{eqn:guhacone},
\end{equation}
where $I_0$ is the incident optical power and
$\mathrm{d}I/\mathrm{d}\Omega$ is the scattered power per solid angle.
$s(\Delta \mathbf{k})$ is the surface roughness spectrum given by the Fourier
transform of the surface autocorrelation function, 
\begin{equation}
|s(\Delta \mathbf{k})|^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{4\pi} \left<S^2\right>
\me^{-(\Delta k^2 \sigma^2)/4}.
\label{eqn:surfaceroughness}
\end{equation}
The final term, $W(\theta_i,\theta_s,\phi)$, is a dipole function of which
describes the interference of two roughness induced currents on the
surface~\cite{raether1997surface}.

For practical purposes, $W(\theta_i,\theta_s,\phi)$ and $s(\Delta
\mathbf{k})$ can be treated as constants if the incident Gaussian beam is
within a small angular range~\cite{heitmann1977determination}.  The angular
width of the cone is approximately
\begin{equation}
\theta_{1/2} = 2 k^{\prime\prime} \frac{c}{\omega \cos \theta},
\end{equation}
on the order of \SI{0.2}{\degree} for LRSPPs and \SI{4}{\degree} for
conventional SPs.  In this regard, $W(\theta_i,\theta_s,\phi)$ and
$s(\Delta \mathbf{k})$ will be neglected 
except in a limited scope in \Chapter{ch:scatteringmicro}, such that
\begin{equation}
|E_\mathrm{cone}|^2 \propto	|t^p_+|^2 |t^p_-|^2.
\label{eqn:conefield}
\end{equation}

Due to the \textit{double} plasmonic enhancement in \Equation{eqn:guhacone},
light in the cone has a smaller angular width than its specular counterpart in
the notch, shown in \Figure{fig:conevsnotch} for a three layer system
($n_1=1.5142$, $n_2=\num{0.2843 + 3.3825i}$, $n_3=1.331$ and
$d_2=\SI{45}{\nano\meter}$).  In \Figure{fig:conevsnotch}, the cone has
been inverted and normalized to the same range as the notch.

%The smaller angular width will enhance
%This aspect causes certain measurements in
%the cone to be more sensitive than those in the notch, an aspect we will
%visit in \Section{sec:bulkri}.
