In the derivation of the plane wave solutions to Maxwell's equations,
Equations~\ref{eqn:planewaves} and~\ref{eqn:planewavesh}, the
frequency-dependent permittivity is a complex parameter
\begin{align}
  \epsilon(\omega) & = \epsilon^\prime + \mi \frac{\sigma}{\omega}   \\
                   & = \epsilon^\prime + \mi\epsilon^{\prime\prime}.
  \label{eqn:complexpermittivity}
\end{align}
%This allows the use of plane wave solutions which are essentially identical
%to the solutions obtained for Maxwell's equations in the absence of
%external fields: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = 0$ and $\mathbf{J} = 0$.  This
%is justified if we can make an adiabatic approximation for the exciting
%field viz. $\sigma\gg1$ and $\rho\approx 0$.

Physically, $\epsilon$ represents both the polarizability in
Equations~\ref{eqn:pdensity} and~\ref{eqn:dfield} and the phase delay
$\delta$ between the scalar $D_0$ and
$E_0$
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon(\omega) = \frac{D_0}{E_0} \,|\epsilon| \,\me^{\mi \delta}.
  \label{eqn:phasedelay}
\end{equation}
%\todo{can't divide vector by vector}
Equations~\ref{eqn:complexpermittivity} and~\ref{eqn:phasedelay} are
consistent with a complex refractive index $\tilde{n} = n(1+\mi \kappa) =
\sqrt{\epsilon}$.

There are several models~\cite{rakic1998optical} from which
the frequency-dependent complex permittivity for metals can be obtained.
As such, it is relevant to be able to convert from one model to another.
Theoretically, the most general expression simply describes
$\epsilon(\omega)$ as a superposition of Lorentzian resonances plus a DC
term,
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon(\omega)= \epsilon_\infty+\sum_n \frac{\sigma_n \omega_n^2} {\omega_n^2-\omega^2-{\mathrm{i}}\omega\Gamma_n}.
  \label{eqn:meepdispersion}
\end{equation}

In \Equation{eqn:meepdispersion} $\epsilon_\infty$ is the low frequency
dielectric response, describing the material's response to a static (DC)
electric field, $\omega_n$ and $\Gamma_n$ are material constants, and
$\sigma_n$ specifies the strength of the $n$th resonance.
\Equation{eqn:meepdispersion} is dimensionless ($c=\hbar=1$), and is usually
encountered when working with numerical simulations of electromagnetic
fields~\cite{oskooi2010meep}.  In most other areas, the Lorentz-Drude model is
used.  Formally, the Lorentz-Drude model is given by
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_\mathrm{LD}(\omega)=\epsilon_\mathrm{D}(\omega)+\epsilon_\mathrm{L}(\omega),
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_\mathrm{D}$ is contribution from the Drude model, representing
free electron effects
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_\mathrm{D}(\omega)=1-\frac{\sqrt{f_0} \omega_p^{\prime 2}}{\omega(\omega -
  \mi\Gamma_0^\prime)},
  \label{eqn:drude}
\end{align}
and $\epsilon_L$ is the Lorentz contribution, representing the bound
electron effects,
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_L(\omega) =\sum_{j=0}^{k}\frac{f_j\omega_p^{\prime 2}}{\omega_j^{\prime
  2}-\omega^2+\mi\omega\Gamma_j^\prime}.
  \label{eqn:lorentzdrude}
\end{align}
In \Equation{eqn:lorentzdrude}, $\omega'_p$ is the plasma frequency of an
electron gas.  The third and perhaps more
accurate~\cite{jahanshahi2014study} model is the
Brendel-Bormann model, based instead on an infinite superposition
of oscillators
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_\text{BB}(\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma_n} \intinfty
  \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\omega'_n)}{2 \sigma_n^2}\right)
  \frac{f_j \omega_p^2}{(x^2-\omega^2)+\mi \omega \Gamma'_n} \md x.
  \label{eqn:brendelbormann}
\end{align}
Converting between \Equation{eqn:meepdispersion} and
Equations~\ref{eqn:drude},~\ref{eqn:lorentzdrude},
and~\ref{eqn:brendelbormann} is accomplished through the substitutions
$\sigma_n = {f_n \omega_p^{\prime 2}}/{\omega_n^2}$, $\epsilon_\infty=1$ and
$\Gamma_n^\prime$.  To prevent numerical instability, in computer codes
$\omega_0$, the DC term, should be a very small but nonzero value, e.g.
$\omega_1 = \num{1e-20}$.

The Drude model considers only free electrons and thus has only a single pole
in its expression, limiting its accuracy.  The agreement with experiment is
particularly bad for metals such as gold and
silver~\cite{ahmedcomputational}~\cite{jahanshahi2014study}, with deviations
of approximately \SI{50}{\percent} in the real part and \SI{150}{\percent} in
the imaginary up to \SI{650}{\micro\meter}.  At higher frequencies the Drude
model continues to diverge and is not applicable.  Furthermore, the higher
error in the imaginary part of $\epsilon$ gives narrower SPR resonances than
are experimentally observed~\cite{jahanshahi2014study}.  The simulations in
this work all use the Lorentz-Drude model which falls within \SI{5}{\percent}
of experimentally determined permittivities in the visible spectrum. A
comparison between the models and experiment is shown in
\Figure{fig:permittivityau} of \Section{ch:reference}.
