In the literature one will find a sense of integerchangability regarding
the terms ``plasmon'', ``surface plasmon'', and ``surface plasmon
polariton''.  To be clear, in this work we are always refering to surface
plasmon \textit{polaritons}: a surface plasmon which is strongly coupled to
the exciting electromagnetic field.  SPPs are a type of
quasiparticle, as they are essentially a collective excitation of free
electrons.  The important property here is that strong coupling
preserves quantum mechanical information.
