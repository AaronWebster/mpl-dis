Physical properties of SPP propagation are derived from their complex
spatial vectors $k_x$ and $k_z$.  Since the SPP is confined to the plane of
the metal, the surface plasmon wavelength $\lambda_\text{sp}$ is defined in
terms of the real part of $k_x$ in
\Equation{eqn:kayexx}~\cite{raether1997surface}.  When $k_x$ is imaginary,
\Equation{eqn:planewavexz} is evanescent in $x$ and the SPP decays with a
characteristic $1/\me$ length $\Im(1/(2k_x))$.  Similarly, when $k_{z,i}$
is imaginary, the $1/\me$ evanescent decay into either the metal or vacuum
is given by $\Im(1/|k_{z,i}|)$.  A table of the physical properties for
different SPP excitation configurations is found in
\Appendix{ref:physicalproperties}.
