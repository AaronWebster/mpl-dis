\end{figure}

We have now arrived at the central aspect of our work, the study of the
CF-QCM sensogram for different load situations.  We begin with an example
dataset, free particles, which is depicted left in
\Figure{fig:expsetup}(b).  Here, free \SI{1}{\micro\meter} streptavidin
coated polystyrene particles in water are introduced into the sample cell.
When the cell is rotated to the loading configuration under the influence
of gravity alone, the particles fall toward the sensing surface and a
positive shift in the QCM's frequency signal is observed.  When the cell is
then rotated 180 degrees to the unloading configuration, the particles fall
off and the frequency response returns to its original state.  Again the
cell is rotated 180 degrees to the loading configuration and the positive
frequency shift is observed.  As the centrifuge spins up towards
\SI{90}{g}, the particles are ``pressed'' towards the QCM surface and a
four fold increase in the frequency shift is observed.  The centrifuge then
spins down and the baseline frequency shift under gravity alone is
recovered.

Traditional QCM experiments assume that the inertial properties and
rigidity of the sample's coupling are taken as a fixed parameter (or
statistical distribution) under assay.  With this approach however, one is
only able to obtain discrete values in an otherwise continuous parameter
space.  Hybrid-QCM experiments involving
nanoindenters~\cite{borovsky2001measuring} or AFM probe
tips~\cite{richter2003pathways} have shown intriguing behavior when force
is applied to a sample in a QCM measurement.  There have also been reports
that accelerations as small as \SI{1}{g} have a measurable effect on a
QCM's response for viscoelastic monolayers such as
DNA~\cite{fawcett2004evidence}, and even for pure Newtonian
liquids~\cite{yoshimoto2002effect}.  All of these responses have been found
to be significant compared to the baseline acceleration sensitivity of the
QCM itself~\cite{filler1988acceleration}.  With the integration of a
centrifuge to a standard QCM, one can observe these effects under enhanced
g-forces and make endpoint measurements (measurements taken after the
addition of a sample) in the sample's parameter space continuously and
repeatedly.

To demonstrate this, we have examined six different samples in the CF-QCM
under variable accelerations from approximately \SIrange{1}{90}{g}.  These
samples were chosen to be examples of the breadth of load situations
accessible with our technique.  They are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item air,
\item deionized water,
\item free particles in water,
\item paramagnetic particles attached to the sensor via short oligonucleotides,
\item \SI{48}{kbp} lambda phage DNAs attached to the gold electrode, and
\item polystyrene particles tethered to the sensor via \SI{48}{kbp} lambda phage DNAs.
\end{enumerate}

The quartz crystals are always cleaned before use by immersion
in fresh piranha solution (3:1 mixture of \SI{97}{\percent} \ce{H2SO4} and
\SI{30}{\percent} \ce{H2O2}) for \SI{5}{\minute} and rinsing liberally with
pure water.

\section{Air}
As a first step, we record the instrument's response in air, shown
parametrically in \Figure{fig:loadplot}(a).  The base acceleration
sensitivity (change in frequency versus change in g-force) of AT cut quartz
normal to the plane of the crystal has a reported
value~\cite{valdois2794influence} of $\df/\Delta g
=\SI{2.188+-0.006e-2}{\hertz\per\g}$ (see
\Table{tbl:environmentaleffects}).  The CF-QCM data shows similar
behavior: $\df/\Delta g =\SI{2.682+-0.023e-2}{\hertz\per\g}$ in the loading
configuration.  The signs of $\df/\Delta g$ are found to be opposite in the
loading and unloading configurations.  Though we have not found a reference for
the bandwidth or motional resistance dependence of a QCM under
acceleration, the data predicts a linear relationship of $\dg/\Delta g =
\SI{9.203+-0.171e-4}{\hertz\per\g}$.

\section{Deionized Water}
Next, we use deionized water as a control sample for measurement in the
liquid phase, as shown in \Figure{fig:loadplot}(b).  The initial shift in
frequency and bandwidth is in agreement with what is obtained the
Kanazawa-Gordon relations~\cite{kanazawa1985frequency} 
\begin{align}
\df=&-f_{\text{F}}^{3/2}\left(\frac{\rho_{\text{L}}\eta_{\text{L}}}{\pi\rho_{q}\mu_{q}}\right)^{1/2}\\
\Delta R=&2f_{\text{F}}L\left(\frac{4\pi
 f_{\text{F}}\rho_{\text{L}}\eta_{\text{L}}}{\rho_{q}\mu_{q}}\right)^{1/2}
\end{align}
where $\rho_{\text{L}}$ and $\eta_{\text{L}}$ are the unknown density and
viscosity of the liquid.   Plugging in the values for water,
$\rho=\SI{1}{\gram\per\centi\meter\cubed}$ and
$\eta=\SI{1}{\milli\pascal\second}$, $\df = \SI{-714}{\hertz}$ and
$R=\SI{359}{\ohm}$, which are close to the measured values of $\df =
\SI{-716}{\hertz}$ and $R=\SI{357}{\ohm}$.  As is evidenced in
\Figure{fig:loadplot}(b), the response under centrifugal
load is linear and smaller than that of air: $\df/\Delta g=
\SI{1.357+-0.024e-2}{\hertz \per\g}$ and $\dg/\Delta g=
\SI{2.865+-0.073e-3}{\hertz\per\g}$ by linear least squares fitting.  

It is obvious here that these acceleration dependent forces in the liquid
phase are not necessarily commensurate with those in the gas phase, but as
the effects are small compared to experiments with actual loads, we will
treat them as baselines to be subtracted.

\section{Free Particles}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=12cm]{qcm/figures/qcm_beadssurface.jpg}
\caption{Free particles on the surface of the QCM, observed with a
microscope to obtain the number density.}
\label{fig:countparticles}
\end{figure}
Utilizing the flexibility that the instrument provides in modifying the
coupling between the load and the sensor surface, we have applied the
technique to the study of discrete micron sized particles.  
Free particles (Spherotech SVP-10-5, SVM-15-10, and SVP-200-4), of
different diameters were prepared by diluting a solution of
\SI{30}{\micro\liter} particles in \SI{300}{\micro\liter} \ce{H2O}.  A
\SI{125}{\micro\liter} aliquot of the \SI{300}{\micro\liter} volume was
then placed in the PDMS cell in contact with the sensing side of the
crystal.  The sensing area was calculated to be
\SI{1.195}{\centi\meter\squared}.  The particles in solution experience a
buoyant force which reduces their apparent mass. The surface density
$N_\mathrm{L}$ was determined as in \Figure{fig:countparticles} by counting the average number of particles
per unit area with a microscope and was found to be within
\SI{20}{\percent} of the value predicted by the volume concentration.

As first referenced in \Figure{fig:expsetup}(b), the frequency and
bandwidth shifts of free particles in the liquid phase as a function of
g-force is shown in \Figure{fig:loadplot}(c).  Here, free streptavidin
coated polystyrene particles, mean diameter
$\bar{d}=\SI{1.07}{\micro\meter}$, are placed in the sample volume with a
surface density of $N_\mathrm{L}=\SI{1.58e11}{\particle\per\meter\squared}$
and the signal is observed in both the loading and unloading
configurations.  The particles did not exhibit adhesion to either the
unmodified gold electrode or the glass/PDMS cell surrounding it; in the
unloading configuration, the particles quickly drifted away from the
sensing area and a signal identical to water was observed.  In the loading
configuration, a large positive shift in $\df$ and $\dg$ was observed,
consistent with previously observed responses for weakly coupled particles
in this size range~\cite{johannsman2007contacts}.  

% This is shown in ... settling velocity, flip cell upside/rightside, etc.

The initial shift under \SI{1}{g} was found to be $\df=
\SI{2.2}{\hertz}$ and $\dg=\SI{7.5}{\hertz}$.  At the maximum acceleration of \SI{90}{g} the
signal increases to $\df = \SI{16.5}{\hertz}$ and $\dg=\SI{37}{\hertz}$. This also
represents a sensitivity enhancement in the minimum resolvable surface
density of the particles.  The scaling of $\df$ and $\dg$ with increasing
centrifugal load is nonlinear in the applied load, implying non-Hertzian
behavior~\cite{borovsky2001measuring}.

The same experiment was also carried out with \num{2}, \num{6}, \num{15},
and \SI{25}{\micro\meter} polystyrene particles.
%(actual mean diameters $d=\bar{d}=1.89, 5.86,, 15\,\mathrm{and}\;\SI{24.8}{\micro\meter}$).
The loading curves all
followed the same trend, but the relative shifts in $\df$ and $\dg$
differed based on particle size.  The results from these loads
are summarized in \Table{tbl:particlesize}.

\section{Oligo Attached Particles}
In contrast to the situation of free particles, we have also studied the
behavior of the CF-QCM in a regime where particles are rigidly coupled to
the sensor by attaching \SI{2}{\micro\meter} (mean diameter
$\bar{d}=\SI{1.89}{\micro\meter}$) streptavidin coated paramagnetic
particles modified with biotinylated \SI{25}{mer} oligos to complimentary
strands conjugated to the QCM gold surface via thiol bonds 

To accomplish this, the crystals were first immersed in a
\SI{1}{\micro\textsc{M}} solution of thiolated oligos (5'-ThioMC6-TTT TTT
TTT CAC TAA AGT TCT TAC CCA TCG CCC-3') in a \SI{1}{\textsc{M}} potassium
phosphate buffer, \SI{0.5}{\textsc{M}} \ce{KH2PO4}, pH 3.8 for
\SI{1}{\hour}.  Following, immersion in \SI{1}{\milli\textsc{M}}
6-Mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) was used to block residual reactive sites on the
gold electrode.  After rinsing, attachment to the prepared particles was
done in STE buffer: \SI{1}{\textsc{M}} \ce{NaCl} with
\SI{10}{\milli\textsc{M}} Tris buffer, pH 7.4 and \SI{1}{\milli\textsc{M}}
EDTA\@.  A complimentary strand (5'-biotin-CT CAC TAT AGG GCG ATG GGT AAG
AAC TTT AGT-3') was attached to the streptavidin coated particles.  The
particles were first washed two times by alliquoting a
\SI{100}{\micro\liter} base solution of particles in \SI{100}{\micro\liter}
STE buffer, \SI{5000}{RPM} for \SI{3}{\minute} and decanting the
supernatant.  The particles were resuspended in \SI{20}{\micro\liter} of
STE buffer and \SI{10}{\micro\gram} of oligos were added.  The mixture was
incubated \SI{15}{\minute} at room temperature under slow vortexing, then
washed again and resuspended in \SI{100}{\micro\liter} STE buffer.  The
oligo attached particle suspension was allowed to attach to the gold
surface for \SI{15}{\minute} before spinning.

The response for oligo attached particles is shown in
\Figure{fig:loadplot}(d).  Note that, $\df$ and $\dg$ are both negative and
decrease with centrifugal force in the loading orientation.  When spinning
with the oligo attached particles, we suspect we are not sensing the
presence of the particle directly but rather the conformational state of
the oligonucleotide layer.  Such an acceleration effect has been observed
before~\cite{yoshimoto2002effect}~\cite{fawcett2004evidence}, but only
within the \SI{2}{g} orientation difference of gravity.  When the oligo
layer is under centrifugal load, it compresses, causing the
density-viscosity product to increase.  This behavior is consistent with
the behavior of DNA observed on QCMs under the influence of gravity
alone~\cite{fawcett2004evidence}.

\subsection{Verification of the Oligo Attachment}
The way we set up the experiment provided two separate mechanisms for
confirming that
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item there were thiolated oligos attached to the QCM gold surface and
\item the particles were rigidly attached to the oligos.
\end{inparaenum}

First, we note that with the attachment of oligos, the motional resistance
of the QCM increased from $R=\SI{357}{\ohm}$ (pure water) to a typical
value of about \SI{550}{\ohm} for oligos with a standard deviation of
\SI{4.3}{\ohm} over five different runs.  Second, while observing the
sample under a microscope, we brought a handheld neodymnium magnet in
proximity to the sample.  In the absence of the oligo attachment, the
particles readily moved from the surface to the magnet.  For samples for
which we believed the particles to be attached, no such motion was
possible.  It was in this way that we convinced ourselves that the
particles were indeed attached to the surface.

%The initial trend in
%frequency follows Sauerbrey (negative frequency shift proportional to mass
%adsorption) like behavior.  For mass loading at this number density, the
%predicted frequency shift is  $\SI{-0.49}{\hertz}$.  At \SI{95}{g}
%$\df = \SI{-30}{\hertz}$, which approximately follows a linear
%increase of inertial mass.  
%We observe a \SI{5}{\percent} change in this product at \SI{90}{g}.  

\section{Lambda DNA}
Moving from particles to viscoelastic monolayers, in
\Figure{fig:loadplot}(e), \SI{48}{kbp} lambda phage DNA in STE buffer were
attached to the gold sensor electrode via a complimentary thiolated oligo.  
Lambda DNAs were prepared by combining \SI{50}{\micro\liter} of lambda DNA
at \SI{500}{\micro\gram\per\milli\liter}, \SI{5.5}{\micro\liter} of 10x T4
ligase, and \SI{0.5}{\micro\liter} of diluted \SI{10}{\micro\textsc{M}}
thiolated linker oligonucleotide and heating to \SI{70}{\celsius} for
\SI{5}{\minute}.  The suspension was left to cool to room temperature as
the litigation of the oligos to the DNA COS ends occured. Once the mixture
was at room temperature, \SI{15}{\micro\liter} 10x ligase buffer,
\SI{127}{\micro\liter} \ce{H2O}, and \SI{2}{\micro\liter} T4 DNA ligase was
added to the annealed linker.  The reaction was allowed to proceed at room
temperature for \SI{3}{\hour}.  Upon the attachment of the lambda DNA, the
motional resistance of the QCM was observed to have increased from its base
value of $R=\SI{357}{\ohm}$ for pure water to a typical value of
\SI{575}{\ohm}.

Previous studies have shown that, through the use of dissipation
monitoring, QCMs are sensitive to not only the adsorbed mass and viscosity,
but the physical conformal state (``shape'') of DNAs hybridized to the
sensor surface~\cite{tsortos2008shear}.  In the experiment, even though the
force on the lambda DNAs is on the order of femtonewtons, we observe a
strong linear decrease ($\dg=\SI{-2.912+-0.0095}{\hertz\per\g}$) in the
bandwidth as function of g-force, indicating an increase in viscoelastic
loss.  However, under larger g-forces the sign of $\df$ reverses.  The
origin of this effect is not understood, but could indicate a nonlinear
viscoelastic compliance under load.  The unloading configuration sees a
smaller negative response in $\dg$ with little effect on $\df$.

At this point we make an observation about the influence of salt buffer,
which was used in experiments involving DNA.  There are several
studies~\cite{encarnaccao2007influence}~\cite{lin1995role} regarding the
effects of various electrolytic buffer solutions and their concentrations
on QCM measurements, including reports of an immersion angle (and therefore
gravity) dependence~\cite{yoshimoto2006characteristics}.  These reports
suggest this effect may be related to the behavior of the interfacial layer
and ion transport in monovalent electrolytic solutions in accelerating
frames~\cite{tolman1911electromotive}~\cite{des1893unpolarisirbare}.  We
have observed a significant contribution in the unloading configuration for
STE buffer alone ($\df=\SI{-0.326+-0.0029}{\hertz\per\g}$, and $\dg$
nonlinear), which was subsequently ``screened''~\cite{zhang2002insulating}
by the presence of both oligos and lambda DNAs, making the effect
negligible in the current set of experiments.  Further investigation is
required to explain this precisely.

\section{Tethered Particles}
With the sensitivity to both particles and monolayers, the instrument
raises a possibility for using beads tethered by lambda DNA as a
transduction mechanism to investigate its kinetics.  One such example is
shown in \Figure{fig:loadplot}(f).  Streptavidin coated polystyrene
particles with a mean diameter of \SI{24.8}{\micro\meter} were tethered to
the CF-QCM by means of a \SI{48}{kbp} lambda phage DNA.  Experiments were
done in STE buffer whose density reduced the maximum force the bead could
exert to about \SI{40}{\pico\newton} which, according to the worm-like
chain model~\cite{marko1995stretching}, should almost fully extend the
lambda DNA to a length of \SI{16}{\micro\meter}.

In addition to the streptavidin coated polystyrene particles, we visually
confirmed the attachment process with a microscope, magnet, and
paramagnetic paricles in the same way as was done for the free particles.

Though the instrument has not yet been developed enough to make accurate
quantitative measurements in this load situation, the behavior of the data
is a clear indication of its potential.  As the tethered bead extends the
DNA under centrifugal force, $\df$ increases and $\dg$ decreases.  In the
case where the DNAs are trapped and pushed between the bead and the
surface, both $\df$ and $\dg$ increase.  We have confirmed the signs of the
shifts in this scenario with \SI{10}{\micro\meter} and \SI{6}{\micro\meter}
paramagnetic particles, using a magnet to either pull or push the
particles toward or away from the sensor surface.  This behavior is
distinct from either the case of lambda DNA or free particles alone.

At $F_\mathrm{c}=\SI{40}{\pico\newton}$, the frequency shift indicates an
effective decrease in the density-viscosity product of \SI{10}{\percent} or
about \SI{1.5}{\pico\gram}.  For the surface densities involved
($N_\mathrm{L}=\SI{3.25e7}{\particle\per\meter\squared}$), the equivalent
interfacial mass lost for a fully extended lambda DNA predicted by the
worm-like chain model are in the picogram range and cannot account for the
more than $10^6$ signal difference shown here.  If indeed the response is
due to lambda DNA extension, future experiments involving high frequency,
large centrifugal force CF-QCMs could easily detect the kinetics of a
single tether.

\section{Particle Sizing}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics{qcm/figures/circlefit.pdf}
\caption{ Particle sizing.  Method for sizing micron-sized particles using the CF-QCM. 
$\df$ versus $\dg$ is plotted parametrically as a function of g-force, and
the data is fit to a circle.  The point on the circle for which $\dg=0$ and
$\df<0$ provides an estimate of mass adsorption, and thus particle size.
Results for particles with diameters $\bar{d}_\mathrm{actual}=1, 2,
15,\,\mathrm{and}\;\SI{25}{\micro\meter}$ are shown in
\Table{tbl:particlesizing}.  Fit circle has a radius of \SI{55.77}{\hertz} and
a center of $(-37.83,41.05) \si{\hertz}$. }
\label{fig:circlefit}
\end{figure}

The coupled oscillator model (\Equation{eqn:mastereq}), when analyzed for
samples of free particles (\Figure{fig:expsetup}(b),
\Figure{fig:loadplot}(c), and \Table{tbl:particlesize}), suggests an avenue
to allow QCMs to determine the size of large micron-sized particles in the
liquid phase.  Thus far this has only been possible with nanometer-sized
particles which lie within the QCM's shear acoustic
wave.~\cite{olsson2013using}  If one plots $\df$ verses $\dg$ in
\Equation{eqn:mastereq} as a parametric function of $\kl$, the points are
found to lie on a circle with radius $r_\mathrm{L}$ (see
\Figure{fig:mechanicalmodel}).  

If we make the approximation that that $\xil\ll \kl$ and that the damping
is small, $\xil\ll1$, the radius is 
\begin{align}
\frac{r_\mathrm{L}}{f_\mathrm{F}} &=
\frac{N_\mathrm{L}}{\pi \mathrm{Z}_\mathrm{q}}
\frac{\left(m_\mathrm{L}\omega_\mathrm{q}\right)^2}{2 \xi_\mathrm{L}}
\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\xi_\mathrm{L}}{m_\mathrm{L}\omega_\mathrm{q}}\right)^2}\\
&\approx \frac{N_\mathrm{L}}{\pi \mathrm{Z}_\mathrm{q}}
\frac{\left(m_\mathrm{L}\omega_\mathrm{q}\right)^2}{2 \xi_\mathrm{L}}, \quad \mathrm{for}\; \xi_\mathrm{L} \ll 1
\label{eqn:radius}
\end{align}
In considering the parametric represenation of $\df$ and $\dg$, the physical mechanism
modifying $\kl$ is removed from the problem.  If we then fit a circle to
the experimentally observed $\df$-$\dg$ data (again, plotted parametrically as a
function of g-force), we can extrapolate the behavior in the strong
coupling regime by finding the point at which $\dg=0$ and $\df<0$.  Knowing
$\df$, \Equation{eqn:couplinguy2} can then be inverted to solve for either
number density or particle size/mass.  An example of this procedure is
shown in \Figure{fig:circlefit} using the same data for
\SI{1}{\micro\meter} particles shown in \Figure{fig:expsetup} and
\Figure{fig:loadplot}.  Inset is a table for the same predictions done for
particles with known diameter $\bar{d}_\mathrm{actual}=1, 2,
15,\,\mathrm{and}\;\SI{25}{\micro\meter}$.  In all cases the surface
density was known and the diameter $\bar{d}_\text{predicted}$ was derived
from the mass $\ml$, found by inverting \Equation{eqn:couplinguy2}.  The
results are surprisingly accurate despite the exploratory nature of the
instrument's construction.  It should also be mentioned that with
knowledge of the way in which the g-force modifies $\kl$, the frequency
zero crossing at $k_\mathrm{zc}=\omegaq^2\ml$ can be used to determine the
mass $\ml$ without knowledge of the number density $N_\mathrm{L}$. 

%\section{Strange Buffer Effects}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Temperature effects as described in the manual are most accurate,
%but are too slow compared to the force-frequency curves we see.
%\item Pressure is also ruled out. The mass difference between water and
%\SI{1}{M} \ce{NaCl} is about \SI{7.5}{\milli\gram}, while the signal
%difference is \SI{-1}{\hertz} for water and \SI{-30}{\hertz} for
%\SI{1}{M} \ce{NaCl}.
%\item Mechanical stress also ruled out for the same reason.
%\end{itemize}
