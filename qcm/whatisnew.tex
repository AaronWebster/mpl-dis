QCMs have been explored in an amazingly wide variety of situations.  Our main
contribution is the study of the response of a \gls{qcm} for samples as
a function of varying centrifugal force fields.  For a sample in contact with
the crystal, this force may be in to or away from the face of the crystal.  We
call the specific combination of force orientation and sample material
a \textit{load situation}.  Thus, our main contribution is the study of the
following load situations:

  \item[{Acceleration Boundary Effects}] While the $kT$ energy of a
        small biomolecule are orders of magnitude greater than gravity (energy,
        gravity, huh?)
        , acceleration effects are readily observable for hybridized
        oligos and buffers stuff.  We confirm the 2g effect for oligos and provide
        data into the 100g range, as well as confirm the effect for random buffer
        solutions.
  \item[{Contact Mechanics}] Pressing beads and looking at the response,
        maybe the equivalent model for contact stiffness in the liquid phase,
        which is just about shear stuffs.
  \item[{Particle Sizing}]
\end{description}
