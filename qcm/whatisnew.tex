QCMs have been studied in a wide variety of situations.  Our main
contriubution is the study of the behavior of different load situations on
samples with respect to a centrifugal force gradients.  In this respect, we
present the following new results

%\begin{description}
%\item[{Acceleration Boundary Effects}] While the $kT$ energy of a
%small biomolecule are orders of magnitude greater than gravity (energy,
%gravity, huh?)
%, acceleration effects are readily observable for hybridized
%oligos and bufers stuff.  We confirm the 2g effect for oligos and provide
%data into the 100g range, as well as confirm the effect for random buffer
%solutions.
%\item[{Contact Mechanics}] Pressing beads and looking at the response,
% maybe the equivalent model for contact stiffness in the liquid phase,
% which is just about shear stuffs.
%\item[{Particle Sizing}]
%\item[{Influence of Electrolystes}]
%\item[{one more thing so this list isn't empty}] That would be nice.
%\end{description}

For a comprehensive overview to the principles and applications of these
mechanical resonators, the reader is directed to \cite{steinemreview}.
