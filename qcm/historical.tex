As sensors, QCMs found their initial applications monitoring thin film
deposition in the vacuum phase.  Here it was found that a QCM would exhibit
a frequency shift $\df$ linearly proportional to the adsorbed mass.  This
work was first carried out by \name{Sauerbrey} in the vacuum phase.  This
\textit{Sauerbrey relation} predicted, and was only valid for,
sub-monolayer thicknesses of rigidly attached (metal, dielectric) layers.
This is the reason the name QCM includes the word ``microbalance''.

Initially it was thought that the low Q mechanical resonance of the QCM
precluded its use in the liquid phase.  This was incorrect, as subsequent
work published in 1985 by \name{Gordon} and
\name{Kanazawa}~\cite{kanazawa1985frequency} extended the treatment of
\name{Sauerbrey} to viscoelastic liquids.  These relations, derived from a
Butterworth van Dyke equivalent circuit, predicted the resonant frequency
of the QCM to be sensitive to the density-viscosity product of the liquid
in contact with the crystal.  In each of these situations, the frequency
shifts were always found to be \textit{negative} as a function of
increasing mass or density-viscosity.

The same year, \name{Dybwad} published a rather elegant
experiment~\cite{dybwad1985sensitive} in which he looked at the frequency
shift of a QCM in air when a single micron sized gold particle was placed
on the sensor surface.  Remarkably, \name{Dybwad} reported a
\textit{positive} frequency shift.  Dybwad explained this result with a
coupled oscillator model, asserting that the gold particle remained at rest
in the laboratory frame while the QCM oscillated beneath it.  The coupling
between the two systems was mediated by the strength of the contact between
the particle and the QCM, which determined the sign of the frequency shift.
In the weak coupling regime, the particle was at rest and the negative
frequency shift predicted by \name{Sauerbrey} was observed.  In the strong
coupling regime, the particle took part in the motion of the QCM, and a
positive frequency shift was observed.  This formalism was more recently
developed by \name{Johannsmann}, exdending the mathematics to encompass
heterogenous collections particles in the liquid
phase~\cite{johannsman2007contacts}.

Further work with nanoindentation probes in the gas phase, particularly by
\name{Borovsky}~\cite{borovsky2001measuring}, looked at the influence of
micron sized spherical tips pressed against the sensor surface.  Here was
observed the same positive frequency shift as \name{Dybwad}, but as a
function of applied force.  This was identifying this with a lateral
(sphere-plate) Hertzian spring constant.

The present concept for applying centrifugal force~\cite{webster2013qcm}
was first proposed by \name{Sato}, inspired by a multiplexed optical
centrifugal force microscopy technique~\cite{halvorsen2010massively}
developed by \name{Halvorsen} and \name{Wong}.  Our work lies in between
that of \name{Johannsmann} and \name{Borovsky}; we conjecture that the
application of force for discrete objects on a QCM will modify their
mechanism of coupling, and this will be a specific feature of the QCM
sensogram.
