There are few experimental techniques that allow the application of force
on biological molecules. Among them, optical or magnetic tweezers and
atomic force microscopes (AFMs) have provided much insight into the
mechanics of molecules such as
DNA~\cite{cui2000pulling}~\cite{marko1995stretching}, improved
understanding of friction and wear in
proteins~\cite{suda2001origin}~\cite{bormuth2009protein}, and have even
been able to observe stepwise motion of motor
proteins~\cite{asbury2003kinesin}.

However powerful, these methods are not able to be deployed as integrated
devices to probe the mechanical properties of heterogeneous samples in a
wide range of applications; tweezer and AFM experiments rely on highly
trained experimentalists, are not widely applicable as analytical tools,
and are often constrained to the analysis of well prepared homogeneous
samples not amenable to multiplexing.

Among tools suitable for direct mechanical transduction, the quartz crystal
microbalance has seen increasing real-world utility as simple, cost
effective, and highly versatile mechanical biosensing platforms. A QCM
typically presents itself as thin disk-shaped piece of strategically cut
piezoelectric quartz with electrodes on either side. When part of an
electronic oscillator circuit, the quartz can form a mechanical resonator
which vibrates at certain fundamental frequencies. Changes in these frequencies
and their associated bandwidths upon sample adsorption or desorption are
related to the properties of the sample and the strength of its coupling to
the QCM. Since its introduction by Sauerbrey~\cite{sauerbrey1959verwendung}
in 1959 as sub-monolayer thin-film mass sensors in the gas phase, the
understanding of these piezoelectric devices has been repeatedly enhanced
to study phenomena such as viscoelastic films in the liquid
phase~\cite{kanazawa1985frequency}, non-destructive contact
mechanics~\cite{johannsman2007contacts}, and complex topologies of
biopolymers and biomacromolecules~\cite{marx2003quartz}. 

Naturally, QCMs do not come without their own disadvantages. The underlying
mechanical properties of the sample are often not revealed by the stepwise
changes in the QCM sensorgram, an issue complicated by the choice of
theoretical model.  Operation of QCMs in the liquid phase is also
associated with a rather low-Q resonance, limiting their sensitivity and
precluding their use for single molecule detection.  Furthermore, up to now
it has not been possible to integrate force on biomolecules in QCM
measurements.

In light of these issues and the analytical power of force based
techniques, we discribe in this part a novel type of instrument that uses a
QCM as a direct mechanical transducer for the response of discrete samples
(molecules, particles) placed in a variable force field provided by a
standard commercial centrifuge.  This \textit{centrifugal force quartz
crystal microbalance} (CF-QCM) concept is about direct introduction of pico
to nanoscale forces in the liquid phase for analyzing the mechanical
properties of biomaterials.

\subsection{Organization}
We begin in this chapter with a small historical perspective and proceed
with a derivation of the relevant mathematics which will allow us to
predict the response of a QCM for samples under centrifugal force.
Following, \Chapter{ch:qcmexperimental} outlines the nuts and bolts of the
CF-QCM; hardware, electronics, and data acquisition.  Drawing on the theory
presented, the main results of this work are presented in
\Chapter{ch:qcmloadsituations} for many different types of samples.  We have
also constructed a finite element simulation which complements the
theoretical model.  This is presented in \Chapter{ch:qcmsimulation} along
with predictions of CF-QCM behavior for samples which we have not yet had
the opportunity to test.
