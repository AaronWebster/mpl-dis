\subsection{The Small Load Approximation}
A rigorous outline of \gls{qcm} theory is well beyond the scope of this work.
Rather, the introduction of \gls{qcm} theory will begin much closer to the
physics relevant to new results presented herein with what is known as the
\textit{small load approximation}.  The small load approximation is a
statement that for a \gls{qcm} under load, the \textit{change} in frequency,
$\df$ and bandwidth (half-width at half maximum of the resonance), $\dg$,
of a \gls{qcm} under load are computed by evaluating the ratio of shear stress to
speed on the oscillating boundary, according to the
relationship~\cite{eggers1987method}~\cite{johannsmann1992viscoelastic}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\df+\mi\Delta\Gamma}{f_{\mathrm{F}}}=\frac{\mi}{\pi Z_{\mathrm{q}}}Z_\mathrm{L} =\frac{\mi}{\pi Z_{\mathrm{q}}}\left<\frac{\sigma}{\dot{u}}\right>
  \label{eqn:comsolextract}
\end{equation}
where $Z_\mathbf{q}$ is the acoustic impedance of AT cut quartz, $\sigma$
is the stress, $\dot{u}$ is the speed of the acoustic wave at the
boundary, $Z_\mathrm{L}$ is the load impedance, $f_{\mathrm{F}}$ is the
fundamental frequency, and $\left<\enspace\right>$ denotes an average
along the boundary.  Since the shear stress is along the $x$-$y$ plane and
the speed along $x$, all quantities are approximated as scalars.
Note that the stress-speed ratio
$\left<\sigma/\dot{u}\right>$ is dimensionally equivalent to specific
acoustic impedance, also called ``shock impedance'', sound pressure over
speed.  In other words, the stress-speed ratio is the impedance of the
film.  Furthermore, note in \Equation{eqn:comsolextract} the common
convention of a complex frequency, where $\df$ represents the maximum of
the resonance and $\dg$ the half-width at half maximum of the same
resonance distribution.

The small load approximation is a perturbation of the main resonance, and
thus is only applicable when the impedance of the load is much smaller than
the impedance of the crystal, $Z_\mathrm{L} \ll Z_\mathrm{q}$, or
equivalently $\df \ll f_\mathrm{F}$.

\subsection{Mechanical Model}

  \caption{Mass-spring-dashpot mechanical model for a \gls{qcm} under load. In the
    weak coupling regime the system experiences a positive frequency shift
    identified with inertial loading, while in the strong coupling regime the
    system experiences a negative frequency shift identified with mass loading.
    The fixed relationship between the shift in frequency $\df$ and bandwidth
    $\dg$ trace out a circle-like path as a parametric function of $\kl$.}
  \label{fig:mechanicalmodel}
\end{figure}

With the small load approximation in mind, a simple mechanical model based
on coupled oscillators is invoked.  The arrangement of the mechanical model
and the frequency response is shown in \Figure{fig:mechanicalmodel}\,(a).  In
\Figure{fig:mechanicalmodel}, the \gls{qcm} is represented by a mass
$m_\mathrm{q}$ on a spring $k_\mathrm{q}$ with a fundamental frequency of
$\omega_\mathrm{q}^2=k_\mathrm{q}/m_\mathrm{q}$, and is coupled to a sample
load with mass $m_\mathrm{L}$ though a parallel spring $k_\mathrm{L}$ and
dashpot $\xi_\mathrm{L}$ representing a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic material.
The spring and dashpot are not \textit{actual} springs and dashpots, rather
they are analogies for the coupling of two systems with different
resonances in the small load approximation analogous with $\ml\ll\mq$.  The
QCM itself has a damping term which is enough to neglect.  The spring $\kl$
represents the ``stiffness'' of the contact --- how strongly the particle is
coupled to the \gls{qcm} surface --- and the dashpot $\xil$ represents energy lost
through the coupling.

The coupled system in \Figure{fig:mechanicalmodel}, for displacements of
$\mq$ by $x_\mathrm{q}$ and $\ml$ by $x_\mathrm{L}$, is described by the
set of differential equations
\begin{align}
  \mq \ddot{x}_\mathrm{q} & = -\kq x_\mathrm{q} +\kl (x_\mathrm{q}-x_\mathrm{L}) + \xil (\dot{x}_\mathrm{q}-\dot{x}_\mathrm{L}) \\
  \ml \ddot{x}_\mathrm{L} & = -\kl (x_\mathrm{q}-x_\mathrm{L}) - \xil (\dot{x}_\mathrm{q}-\dot{x}_\mathrm{L}),
\end{align}
which, using an ansatz of
$x_\mathrm{q}A_\mathrm{q}$ and $x_\mathrm{L}=A_\mathrm{L}\me^{\mi \omega
    t}$,
eigenvalues $\omega$ of
$N_\mathrm{L}$ is a number surface density (number per unit area) for discrete
loads.

Using the small load approximation, the response of the system
as a function of its coupling $\kl$ is then
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Delta\!f + \mi \Delta \Gamma}{f_\mathrm{F}} = \frac{N_\mathrm{L}}{\pi
    \mathrm{Z}_\mathrm{q}}
  \frac{\ml \omega_\mathrm{q} \left( \kl + \mi
    \omega_\mathrm{q} \xil\right) }
  {\ml \omega_\mathrm{q}^2 - \left(\kl + \mi
    \omega_\mathrm{q} \xil\right)}.
  \label{eqn:mastereq}
\end{equation}

The mechanical model shown in \Figure{fig:mechanicalmodel}\,(b) has
two important regimes as a function of the contact stiffness $\kl$ known
as \textit{strong} and \textit{weak} coupling.  The strong and weak
coupling regimes occur to the left and right of a zero crossing in $\df$ at
$k_\mathrm{zc}=\omegaq^2 \ml$, and are given asymptotically by
%\vspace{-\baselineskip}
%\vspace{-\parskip}
\begin{align}
  \frac{\df}{f_\mathrm{F}} & =
  \frac{N_\mathrm{L} \kl}
  {\omegaq\pi \mathrm{Z}_\mathrm{q}}
                           & \,                     & \left(\text{weak,}\quad \kl\ll \ml
  \omegaq^2\right)
  \label{eqn:couplinguy1}
  \\
  \frac{\df}{f_\mathrm{F}} & =  -\frac{N_\mathrm{L}
    \ml \omegaq}{\pi Z_\mathrm{q}}
                           & \,                     & \left(\text{strong,}\quad \kl\gg \ml
  \omegaq^2\right),
  \label{eqn:couplinguy2}
\end{align}
where it is recognized $\dg$ goes to zero in either limit.

The strong coupling regime is identified with mass loading
(Sauerbrey~\cite{sauerbrey1959verwendung} behavior) and a \textit{negative}
frequency shift linearly proportional $\ml$.  Sauerbrey behavior in the
strong coupling regime is most commonly associated with \gls{qcm} measurements,
identified by rigid coupling such that the load takes part in the
oscillation of the \gls{qcm}.@.  In the opposite limit is the weak coupling regime,
also called inertial loading~\cite{dybwad1985sensitive}, which is identified
by a \textit{positive} frequency shift independent of the mass and linearly
proportional to $\kl$.  In the weak coupling regime, the coupling is
sufficiently weak such that the particle remains at rest in the laboratory
frame.  It is ``clamped'' by its own inertia~\cite{du2008role}.

%As sensors, \gls{qcm}. found their initial applications monitoring thin film
%deposition in vacuums.  Here it was found that a \gls{qcm} would exhibit a
%frequency shift $\df$ proportional to the adsorbed mass $m$
%\begin{equation}
% \df=-\frac{2f_{F}^{2}}{A\sqrt{\rho_{q}\mu_{q}}}\Delta m
% \label{eqn:sauerbrey}
%\end{equation}
%where $A$ is the active area of the crystal, $\Delta m$ is the adsorbed
%mass, $\rho_{q}$ is the density of quartz and $\mu_{q}$ is the shear
%modulus of quartz. Usually \Equation{eqn:sauerbrey} is condensed such that
%$\Delta m$ is a linear function of a single ``sensitivity factor''
%$C_\mathrm{f}$
%\begin{equation}
% \Delta f=-C_{\text{f}}\Delta m
%\end{equation}
%where $C_{\text{f}}=\SI{56.6}{\hertz\per\micro\gram\centi\meter\squared}$.
%\Equation{eqn:sauerbrey} is known as the
%\textit{Sauerbrey relation}.  A typical \gls{qcm} might have a
%$f_F=\SI{5}{\mega\hertz}$ and a frequency resolution of \SI{0.1}{\hertz};
%\Equation{eqn:sauerbrey} predicts sub-monolayer (and is only valid in this
%range) resolution of the thickness
%metal and dielectric layers.  This is the reason the name \gls{qcm} includes the
%word ``microbalance''.
%
%Initially it was thought that the low $Q$ mechanical resonance of the QCM
%precluded its use in the liquid phase.  This was incorrect, as subsequent
%work published in 1985 by \name{Gordon} and \name{Kanazawa}~\cite{guys} extended the
%treatment of \name{Sauerbrey} to the liquid phase.  These relations,
%derived from a Butterworth van Dyke equivalent circuit, predicted the
%resonant frequency of the QCM
%to be sensitive to the density-viscosity product of the liquid in contact
%with the crystal,
%\begin{align}
%\df=&-f_{\text{F}}^{3/2}\left(\frac{\rho_{\text{L}}\eta_{\text{L}}}{\pi\rho_{q}\mu_{q}}\right)^{1/2}\\
%\Delta R=&2f_{\text{F}}L\left(\frac{4\pi
% f_{\text{F}}\rho_{\text{L}}\eta_{\text{L}}}{\rho_{q}\mu_{q}}\right)^{1/2}
%\end{align}
%where $\rho_{\text{L}}$ and $\eta_{\text{L}}$ are the unknown density and
%viscosity of the liquid.  Note that in the treatment by both Sauerbrey and
%Gordon and Kanazawa, the frequency shifts are always \textit{negative} as a
%function of increasing mass or density-viscosity.
%
%Here, the quartz crystal with mass $\mq$ and stiffness
%$\kq$ resonates at
%$\omega_\mathrm{q}^2=\kq/\mq$ and is coupled by a spring
%$\kl$ to a load mass $\ml$.  The load mass is the actual mass of
%the particle, $4/3 \pi r^3 \rho$.  The spring $\kl$ represents the
%``stiffness'' of the contact -- how strongly the particle is coupled to the
%QCM surface.  The coupled system in \Figure{fig:dybwadschema} is described
%by the differential equations
%\begin{align}
% \mq \ddot{x}_\mathrm{q} &= -\kq x_\mathrm{q}\\
% \ml \ddot{x}_\mathrm{L} &= -\kl (x_\mathrm{q}-x_\mathrm{L})
%\end{align}
%which, using an ansatz of
%$x_{\mathrm{q},\mathrm{L}}=A_{\mathrm{q},\mathrm{L}}\me^{\mi \omega t}$ has
%eigenvalues $\omega$ of
%\begin{equation}
% 2\omega^{2}=\left(\frac{\kq}{\mq}+\frac{\kl}{\mq}+\frac{\kl}{m}\right)\pm\left(\left(\frac{\kq}{\mq}+\frac{\kl}{\mq}+\frac{\kl}{\ml}\right)^{2}-4\frac{\kq}{\mq}\frac{\kl}{\ml}\right)^{1/2}
% \label{eqn:dybwadresult}
%\end{equation}
