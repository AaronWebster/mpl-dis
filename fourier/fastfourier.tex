\section{Numerical Evaluation of the Fourier Integral}

The Fourier integral in Equations \ref{eqn:fourier123} and
\ref{eqn:fourier321} has, in general, no analytic solution.  It's
evaluation therefore must be carried out numerally.  By far the most
efficient way of doing so is by using a fast Fourier transform (FFT),
however this requires specific scaling of the domain and range of the
output field.
