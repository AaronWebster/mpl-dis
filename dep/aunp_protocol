Surface Functionalization

- Prepare 1mM ethanolic solution of 1,6-hexanedithiol.  Use dry ethanol, no
	water!
- Degas with N2.  I guess oxygen will work to make both ends of C6 stick to
	the gold surface, which you don't want.
-  The whole experiment is done under N2 atmosphere (schenk line).
- 50nm gold coated coverslips were made using the standard procedure and
	placed upright in solution for 18 hours in the dark.

This should create an angled SAM with one thiol sticking out.
