@inbook{johannsman2007contacts,
	Abstract = {The quartz crystal microbalance can serve as
		  high-frequency probe of the microcontacts formed between
		  the crystal surface and a solid object touching it. On a
		  simplistic level, the load can be approximated by an
		  assembly of point masses, springs, and dashpots. The
		  Sauerbrey model, leading to a decrease in frequency, is
		  recovered if small particles are rigidly attached to the
		  crystal. In another limiting case, the particles are so
		  heavy that inertia holds them in place in the laboratory
		  frame. The spheres exert a restoring force onto the
		  crystal, thereby increasing the stiffness of the composite
		  resonator. The resonance frequency increases in proportion
		  to the lateral spring constant of the sphere--plate
		  contacts. A third limiting case is represented by particles
		  attached to the crystal via a dashpot. Within this model
		  (extensively used in nanotribology) the dashpot increases
		  the bandwidth. The momentum relaxation time τS (``slip
		  time'') is calculated from the ratio of the increase in
		  bandwidth and the decrease in frequency, Δf. The
		  force--displacement relations in contact mechanics are
		  often nonlinear. A prominent example is the transition from
		  stick to slip. Even for nonlinear interactions, there is a
		  strictly quantitative relationship between the shifts of
		  frequency and bandwidth, Δf and ΔΓ, on the one hand, and
		  the force acting on the crystal, F(t), on the other. Δf
		  and ΔΓ are proportional to the in-phase and the
		  out-of-phase component of F(t), respectively. Evidently,
		  F(t) cannot be explicitly derived from Δf and ΔΓ. Still,
		  any contact-mechanical model (like the Mindlin model of
		  partial slip) can be tested by comparing the predicted and
		  the measured values of Δf and ΔΓ. Further experimental
		  constraints stem from the measurement of the amplitude
		  dependence of the resonance parameters. Contacts mechanics
		  in the MHz range is much different from its low-frequency
		  counterpart. For instance, static friction coefficients
		  probed with MHz excitation are often much above 1. Contact
		  mechanics at short time scales should be of substantial
		  practical relevance.},
