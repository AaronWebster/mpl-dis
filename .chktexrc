# ChkTeX configuration for modern LaTeX best practices
# This file configures chktex to enforce modern LaTeX coding standards

# Suppress specific warnings that are too strict or not applicable
# for academic dissertation writing:

# Warning 1: Command terminated with space
# Often intentional in macro definitions
# -n1

# Warning 8: Wrong length of dash
# Minus signs in math expressions are correct
# -n8

# Warning 13: Interword spacing  
# Too pedantic for normal academic writing
# -n13

# Warning 46: Use \vspace instead of \\[...]
# This is sometimes needed for specific formatting
# -n46

# To suppress a warning, uncomment the corresponding -n flag above
# and pass it via command line: chktex -n1 -n8 file.tex

# Or suppress inline in .tex files with:
# % chktex-file 1 8 13
