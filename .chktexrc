# ChkTeX configuration for modern LaTeX best practices
# This file configures chktex to enforce modern LaTeX coding standards

# Enable all warnings by default
# Then selectively disable ones that are too strict for academic writing

# Disable warning 1 (command terminated with space) as it's often intentional
# in macro definitions and can be overly pedantic
CmdSpaceWarning { }

# Disable warning 8 (wrong length of dash) for mathematical expressions
# where minus signs are used intentionally
QuoteStyle { }

# Keep warning 11 (use \ldots for ellipsis) enabled as it's good practice
# but allow \cdots in math mode which is correct usage

# Disable warning 13 (interword spacing) - too pedantic for normal writing
InterWord { }

# Enable warning for non-breaking spaces before references
# This is important for professional typesetting
