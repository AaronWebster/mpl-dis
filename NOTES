History and Significance

Some things to add to the thinger:

- angular sensitivity of the ring guy

- nanoparticle synthesis
	"instentaneous and quantitative functionalizetion of gold nanoparticles
	with thiolated DNA unsing a PHassisted and surfactant-free route
	
	+ take extension curves for AuNPs


- new work with gregory
	+ old work with gregory
	+ all things from WLGR-plasmon

- long range surface plasmons and how to make the grating business

- microfluidic protocols

- CBS cone measurements

- scattering stuffs

- coherent backscattering experiment


Protocols
---------

Have a section here where you just state plainly the different protocols so
as not to detract too much from the main text.
