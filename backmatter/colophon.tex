This document was typeset using pdf\LaTeX. All plots were rendered using
pgfplots~\cite{feuersangerpgfplots} with styles influenced by
\name{Eduard~Tufte}~\cite{tufte1983visual}~\cite{tufte1991envisioning}.
Colors were chosen from datasets provided by
\name{Jan~Brewer}~\cite{harrower2003colorbrewer}.  Schematics and other
line drawings were prepared using Inkscape. Generation of text was done
under Arch Linux using \texttt{vim}.  Some tables were pre-processed using
LyX.

The Monte Carlo simulations were written in \texttt{c} with parallelism
accomplished using \texttt{mpi}. The vortex tracking and image processing
algorithms were written in \texttt{octave}.  Weirdospace images were
processed using python and scipy/numpy.  Parallel execution when required
was done at the FAU RRZE, Erlangen, Germany.  Multiple scattering code
written by \name{Matthew~Foreman} was written in \texttt{MATLAB}.  All sources
available through the author.
