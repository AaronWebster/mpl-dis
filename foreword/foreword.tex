This dissertation is all about what happens when surface plasmon polaritons
interfere and scatter in a prism coupled setup.  The easiest way of
understanding this is though a simplified dipiction of the experimental
setup, shown in \Figure{fig:kretschmanngeo}.

Light is incident from the left and focussed by lens $f_1$ on to the
hypotenuse of a hemispherical prism $\epsilon_1$ coated with a thin layer
of metal, $\epsilon_2$.  The refractive index of
the sample, $\epsilon_3$, is opposite.  $f_2$ acts to image light exiting
the system, if required.

The evanescent wave present on the $\epsilon_1$-$\epsilon_2$ boundary with
a wavenumber $k_x = k_0\sqrt{\epsilon_1}\sin \thetasp$ has an angle such
that it excites surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs); oscillations of free
charge strongly coupled to the photons of the incident beam.  The majority
of light is directed into the specular direction.  Here, re-radiated SPPs
at $\thetasp$ are antiphase with the excitation beam.  The result is
interference: a dark band or notch in the reflected field.  The angular
location of the notch turns out to be extrordinarily sensitive to
$\epsilon_3$ -- this is the common way to view surface plasmon resonance in
a biosensing context.  

SPPs will propagate on the $\epsilon_2$-$\epsilon_3$ layer until
they either decay as heat or scatter into the far field.  During this
propagation it is possible that surface roughness will elastically modify
its $k$-vector in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane.  When this happens, scattered SPPs
will re-radiate into a thin annular cone at (nearly) the same angle as the
dark band in the specular direction.

The conically scattered light is of prime importance for us, because within
this light is found a wealth of information directly related to the SPP
scattering.  In particular, the cone contains speckle: a seemingly random
interference pattern resulting from many components with different phases.

\section{What is New Here}
In many large works it is sometimes difficult to discern what is actually
new from rehashings of things others have done.  Here I intended to clarify
this situation.  To this accord, the following is a list of explicitly new
results which I present:

\begin{description}
\item[{Interference of Scattered SPPs}]
For SPPs excited in the Kretschmann configuration with a focussed beam
whose propagation distance is larger than focal spot, a particular one-sided
interference pattern, is observed in the specular direction.  This was
thought to be an interference effect between the specularly reflected beam
and a re-radiated plasmon component, but we have discovered a further
insight in intrepreting it as a simple consequence of causality.
\item[{Bulk Refractive Index Sensitivity}] 
Using Fourier analysis, we have studied the sensitivity of SPR in an intensity
interrogation configuration as a function of propagation distance.  This
provides a useful measure of the sensitivity of the one-sided interference
pattern found in the specular and conically directed beams.
\item[{Refractive Index Sensing With Conical Speckle}]
If the surface is rough, the conically directed light contains speckle.  We
have analyzed the speckle patterns as a function of changes in bulk
refractive index.
\item[{SPP Nanoparticle Scattering}]
Using the speckle in the cone, we observe the changes in intensity and
correlation functions associated with the addition or motion of a single
nanoparticle.
After writing, update the list with all the new stuff.
