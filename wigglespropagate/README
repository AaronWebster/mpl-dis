How these plots are made:

Each directory has its own complete set of scripts.  It's redundant, but I
don't care.  To use, first decend into a single directory.  Run
./findparams.py, which finds the minimum reflectivity for angle and metal
thickness for the fresnel three layer system.  Put the output of this to
the head of fftwiggles.m.  Make sure it converges on an ideal result, as
sometimes it gets caught up and converges on a minimum thickenss of 0
(WRONG!).  

Once this is done, make sure that the file fresnelpropagate.tex has the
correct directory definition.

Last, run ./mkdats.m, which will make all the data files.
