%\section{Synopsis}
%\label{sec:synopsis}
%This dissertation is all about what happens when surface plasmon polaritons
%interfere and scatter in a prism coupled setup.  The easiest way of
%understanding this is though a simplified dipiction of the experimental
%setup, shown in \Figure{fig:kretschmanngeo}.

%the three layer Kretschmann configuration. } 
%\label{fig:kretschmanngeo} 
%\end{figure}
%Light is incident from the left and focussed by lens $f_1$ on to the
%hypotenuse of a hemispherical prism $\epsilon_1$ coated with a thin layer
%of metal, $\epsilon_2$.  The refractive index of
%the sample, $\epsilon_3$, is opposite.  $f_2$ acts to image light exiting
%the system, if required.
%
%The evanescent wave present on the $\epsilon_1$-$\epsilon_2$ boundary with
%a wavenumber $k_x = k_0\sqrt{\epsilon_1}\sin \thetasp$ has an angle such
%that it excites surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs); oscillations of free
%charge strongly coupled to the photons of the incident beam.  The majority
%of light is directed into the specular direction.  Here, re-radiated SPPs
%at $\thetasp$ are antiphase with the excitation beam.  The result is
%interference: a dark band or notch in the reflected field.  The angular
%location of the notch turns out to be extrordinarily sensitive to
%$\epsilon_3$ -- this is the common way to view surface plasmon resonance in
%a biosensing context.  
%
%SPPs will propagate on the $\epsilon_2$-$\epsilon_3$ layer until
%they either decay as heat or scatter into the far field.  During this
%propagation it is possible that surface roughness will elastically modify
%its $k$-vector in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane.  When this happens, scattered SPPs
%will re-radiate into a thin annular cone at (nearly) the same angle as the
%dark band in the specular direction.
%
%The conically scattered light is of prime importance for us, because within
%this light is found a wealth of information directly related to the SPP
%scattering.  In particular, the cone contains speckle: a seemingly random
%interference pattern resulting from many components with different phases.
%
%\section{What is New Here}
%In many large works it is sometimes difficult to discern what is actually
%new from rehashings of things others have done.  Here I intended to clarify
%this situation.  To this accord, the following is a list of explicitly new
%results which I present:
%
%\begin{description}
%\item[{Interference of Scattered SPPs}]
%For SPPs excited in the Kretschmann configuration with a focussed beam
%whose propagation distance is larger than focal spot, a particular one-sided
%interference pattern, is observed in the specular direction.  This was
%thought to be an interference effect between the specularly reflected beam
%and a re-radiated plasmon component, but we have discovered a further
%insight in intrepreting it as a simple consequence of causality.
%\item[{Bulk Refractive Index Sensitivity}] 
%Using Fourier analysis, we have studied the sensitivity of SPR in an intensity
%interrogation configuration as a function of propagation distance.  This
%provides a useful measure of the sensitivity of the one-sided interference
%pattern found in the specular and conically directed beams.
%\item[{Refractive Index Sensing With Conical Speckle}]
%If the surface is rough, the conically directed light contains speckle.  We
%have analyzed the speckle patterns as a function of changes in bulk
%refractive index.
%\item[{SPP Nanoparticle Scattering}]
%Using the speckle in the cone, we observe the changes in intensity and
%correlation functions associated with the addition or motion of a single
%nanoparticle.
%After writing, update the list with all the new stuff.

%\section{Organization}
%How all this is organized.  Should probably be written last.

%\chapter{Foundations}
%\label{ch:foundations}
%\section{Historical Perspective}
%The theoretical groundwork for the existence of surface plasmon polaritons
%(SPPs) was first introduced by \name{Richie} in his seminal 1957 paper
%\textit{Plasma Losses by Fast Electrons in Thin Films}
%\cite{ritchie1957plasma}.  Like any scientific work, Richie's was
%incremental and has its roots in earlier theoretical proposals by
%\name{Pines} and
%\name{Bohm}~\cite{bohm1951collective}~\cite{pines1952collective}.
%Ultimately this research functioned to explain the phenomena of sharp and
%spectrally narrow energy losses observed in diffraction gratings by
%\name{Wood} in 1902, known as ``Wood's anomaly''.
%
%Optical excitation of surface plasmons was made accessible through
%pioneering work in the late 1960's by
%\name{Kretschmann}~\cite{kretschmann1968},
%\name{Raether}~\cite{raether1965springer} and
%\name{Otto}~\cite{otto1968excitation}.  These experiments used the
%principle of attenuated total reflection (ATR) to excite surface plasmons
%evanescently, using a prism to match their resonance condition.  A great
%deal of understanding on the topic of surface plasmons took place in the
%subsequent decade, including an improved theoretical understanding based on
%Fresnel relations \cite{chen1976excitation} and descriptions of of
%conically scattered light in the presence of surface
%roughness~\cite{simon1976directional}.  A concise overview of this research
%can be found in~\cite{raether1997surface}.
%
%The introduction of SPR as a biosensing platform began in the early 1980's
%with work by \name{Liedberg}, \name{Nylander} and
%\name{Lundstrom}~\cite{liedberg1983surface} who described the
%extraordinary sensitivity of the surface plasmon resonance condition to
%perturbations in the refractive index of the medium on one side of the
%metal film.  The subsequent commercialization of SPR biosensors has largely
%been influenced by these authors and Pharmacia Biosensor AB (now
%Biacore)~\cite{liedberg1995biosensing}.
%
%The commercial success of biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance
%brought about a knowledge gap between the biosensing community and their
%more theoretical predecessors from whom the field owes its genesis; the
%scope of SPR biosensing experiments is disproportionately narrower than the
%breadth of phenomena discovered since Richie.  As an example particular to
%this dissertation, in 2005 and 2007, two
%papers~\cite{andaloro2005optical}~\cite{simon2007observation} based on
%theoretical work by \name{Chuang}~\cite{chuang1986lateral} and
%\name{Chen} \cite{chen1976excitation} reported a curious interference
%pattern occurring in the specularly reflected light for certain (among
%them, Kretschmann-Raether type) systems illuminated with focused Gaussian
%beams.  This was also independently reported a year later in
%\cite{schumann2008near}.  Interestingly, observation of this interference
%required nothing more than the addition of a lens pair to a fairly
%ubiquitous optical setup, but it somehow escaped attention during earlier
%research.  
%
%The thrust of this work is primarily inspired by experiments done at the
%University of Oregon in the labratory of \name{Stephen Gregory}, summarized
%in a 2009 thesis \textit{Surface Plasmon Random Scattering and Related
%Phenomena} \cite{schumann2009surface} by \name{R\@.P.\@~Schumann}.  Here
%the authors describe plasmon experiments with scanning apertureless
%near-field probes in a Kretschmann-Raether type configuration.  This probe
%(a sharp tungsten tip) is able to elastically scatter SPPs in a way
%analogous to surface roughness, but in this case its location and
%interaction of a single scatterer can be precisely controlled.  We will
%show that similar experiments can be carried out in the context of
%biosensing, using metallic nanoparticles as scatterers.
%
%The final important historical development we cross is that of correlations
%in elastic multiple scattering through disordered media.  Most notable is
%the seminal paper by \name{Feng}, \name{Lee}, \name{Stone}, and
%\name{Douglas}~\cite{feng1988correlations}.  Here it was established that
%the seemingly random fluctuations in the output channel through a
%disordered system are not random at all, but contain correlations which
%track the behavior of the input channel.  In the optical regime these
%fluctuations are known as speckle, whose statistal properties have been
%explored in depth by
%\name{Goodman}~\cite{goodman2007speckle}~\cite{goodman1975statistical}.
%The important implications speckle correlations were perhaps best
%summarized by \name{Berkovits} and
%\name{Feng}~\cite{berkovits1994correlations}.  These works established that
%the multiple scattering regime is extraordinary sensitive to both the
%position~\cite{berkovits1990theory} and
%motion~\cite{berkovits1991sensitivity} of even a single scatterer.  This
%problem has important implications in many diverse fields of study:
%diffusive wave spectroscopy~\cite{pine1988diffusing}, tracking and
%identification of targets with radio waves (the ``cruise missile
%problem''~\cite{atkins1991neural}), fluctuations in signal power in
%cellular telephone networks (Rice fading~\cite{abdi2001estimation}), and
%very recently in detecting stress fractures in aggregates such as
%concrete~\cite{larose2010locating}.  
%
%%Our historical perspective ends here.  Scattering of surface plasmons
%%affords one a unique system with which to study these effects.  By changing
%%the amount of surface roughness, 
%
%\section{Surface Plasmon Polaritons}
%A photon is a quantized oscillation of an electromagnetic field.  When this
%field is in proximity to an interface such as the surface of a metal,
%oscillations of free charge can be induced.  If the field is evanescent in
%both directions orthogonal to the surface, the oscillations become
%localized and are known as surface plasmons (SPs).  Furthermore, if
%conditions exist such that the in-plane momentum and phase of the incident
%photon and the surface plasmon match, the coupling produces a hybrid
%excitation known as surface plasmon polariton (SPP).  An SPP is trapped on
%this interface and propagates until it decays; either re-radiating as a
%photon or being absorbed into the metal as heat.
%
%
%\subsection{Wave Equation}
%Most of the relevant behavior of SPP propagation can be derived from the
%electromagnetic wave equation derived from Maxwell's equations.
%\begin{align}
%\left(\nabla^2-\mu\epsilon\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\right)\mathbf{E}&=0
%\label{eqn:ewe}
%\end{align}
%This is the electromagnetic wave equation in terms of the electric field.
%Choosing to solve this equation by separation of variables the following
%plane wave solutions can be obtained
%\begin{align}
% \mathbf{E} ( \mathbf{r}, t ) &= \mathbf{E}_0\, \me^{\mi (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t )}
%\label{eqn:planewaves}
%\end{align}
%where $k=\omega/c=\omega\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}$.  In this notation,
%$\mathbf{k}$ is the material specific vectorial wavenumber, $\mathbf{r}$ is the
%spatial position, $\omega$ is angular frequency, and $t$ is
%the dimension of time.
%The initial value is chosen with the vectorial constant $\mathbf{E}_0$.
%The magnetic field follows the same form
%\begin{align}
% \mathbf{H} ( \mathbf{r}, t ) &= \mathbf{H}_0\, \me^{\mi (\mathbf{k}
% \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t )}
%\end{align} 
%but it is orthogonal $\mathbf{E}$ by
%\begin{align}
%\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H} = 0
%\end{align}
%and the two are mutually orthogonal with the direction of propagation
%$\mathbf{k}$.
%
%\subsection{Dispersion Relation}
%With plane wave solutions in hand, boundary conditions consistent with a
%dielectric-metal interface can be imposed.
%At a planar interface, it is convenient to restrict the problem to two
%dimensions; in this case the $x$-$z$ plane as shown schematically in
%\Figure{fig:kretschmanngeosimplified}.  Since $\mathbf{k}=(k_x,0,k_z)$,
%$\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{k}=k_x x + k_z z$ and $\mathbf{E}_0 = (E_x, 0,
%E_z)$, the electric field can be written 
%\begin{align}
%\mathbf{E} ( \mathbf{r}, t ) &= \mathbf{E}_0\, \me^{\mi (\mathbf{k}
%\cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t )}\\
%\mathbf{E}(x,z,t)&=\begin{pmatrix}
%E_x\\ 0\\ E_z
%\end{pmatrix}
%\, \me^{\mi(k_{x,i}x+k_{z,i}z-\omega t)}
%\label{eqn:planewavexz}
%\end{align}
%The magnetic field propagates in the same direction with the
%same $\mathbf{k}$-vector components, but the direction
%$\mathbf{H}$ must be orthogonal to $\mathbf{E}$ by
%\Equation{eqn:faradayslaw}
%\begin{align}
%\mathbf{H} ( \mathbf{r}, t ) &= \mathbf{H}_0\, \me^{\mi (\mathbf{k}
%\cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t )}\\
%\mathbf{H}(x,z,t)&=\begin{pmatrix}
%0\\ H_y\\ 0
%\end{pmatrix}
%\, \me^{\mi(k_{x,i}x+k_{z,i}z-\omega t)}
%\end{align}
%At the interface there are two values for the (complex) permittivity,
%$\epsilon_1$ in the dielectric and $\epsilon_2$ in the metal.  Consequently
%there are two sets of plane wave solutions
%\begin{align}
%\left.\begin{aligned}
%\mathbf{H}_1(x,z,t) &=
%\begin{pmatrix}
%0\\
%H_{y,1}\\
%0
%\end{pmatrix} \me^{\mi(k_{x,1}x+k_{z,1}z-\omega t)}\\
%\mathbf{E}_1(x,z,t) &=
%\begin{pmatrix}
%E_{x,1}\\
%0\\
%E_{z,1}\\
%\end{pmatrix} \me^{\mi(k_{x,1}x+k_{z,1}z-\omega t)}
%\end{aligned}
%\right\}& \quad \text{dielectric}, \epsilon_1\label{eqn:planewavedielectric}\\
%\left.\begin{aligned}
%\mathbf{H}_2(x,z,t) &=
%\begin{pmatrix}
%0\\
%H_{y,2}\\
%0
%\end{pmatrix}
%\me^{\mi(k_{x,2}x+k_{z,2}z-\omega t)}\\
%\mathbf{E}_2(x,z,t) &=
%\begin{pmatrix}
%E_{x,2}\\
%0\\
%E_{z,2}\\
%\end{pmatrix}
%\me^{\mi(k_{x,2}x+k_{z,2}z-\omega t)}
%\end{aligned} 
%\right\}&\quad \text{metal}, \epsilon_2
%\label{eqn:planewavemetal}
%\end{align}
%where the subscript designates which material the wave equation refers to.
%(e.g. $\mathbf{E}_1$ is the electric field in the dielectric, $\mathbf{H}_2$
%the magnetic field in the metal, etc.)
%Continuity of \Equation{eqn:planewavedielectric} and
%\ref{eqn:planewavemetal} at this interface requires that
%\begin{align}
%E_{x,2}&=E_{x,1}\\
%H_{y,2}&=H_{y,1}\\
%\epsilon_2 E_{z,2}&=\epsilon_1 E_{z,1}
%\end{align}
%Applying Ampere's law (\Equation{eqn:ampereslaw}) to the field on the
%each boundary gives
%\begin{align}
%\nabla \times \mathbf{H}_i &= \epsilon_i \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}_i}{\partial t}\\
%\begin{pmatrix}
%\frac{\partial H_{z,i}}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial H_{y,i}}{\partial z}\\
%\frac{\partial H_{x,i}}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial H_{z,i}}{\partial z}\\
%\frac{\partial H_{y,i}}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial H_{x,i}}{\partial z}
%\end{pmatrix}
%&= \begin{pmatrix}
%-\mi k_{z,i} H_{y,i}\\
%0\\
%\mi k_{x,i} H_{y,i}
%\end{pmatrix}
%\\
%&= \begin{pmatrix}
%-\mi \omega \epsilon_i E_{x,i}\\
%0\\
%-\mi \omega \epsilon_i E_{z,i}
%\end{pmatrix}
%\label{eqn:vectordisp}
%\end{align}
%where $\mathbf{E}_i$, $\mathbf{H}_i$, $i=1,2$ represent the field in either the
%dielectric or the metal.  The vector components of
%\Equation{eqn:vectordisp} are therefore related 
%\begin{align}
%-\mi k_{z,i} H_{y,i} &= -\mi \omega \epsilon_i E_{x,i}\\
%k_{z,1} H_{y,1} &= \omega \epsilon_1 E_{x,1}\\
%k_{z,2} H_{y,2} &= \omega \epsilon_2 E_{x,2}
%\label{eqn:spderivsteptwo}
%\end{align}
%Since the components of both $\mathbf{E}_i$ and $\mathbf{H}_i$ are
%parallel to the interface, $E_{x,i}$ and $H_{y,i}$ are also
%continuous. By substitution of $E_{x,i}$, \Equation{eqn:spderivsteptwo} becomes
%\begin{align}
%\frac{k_{z,1}}{\epsilon_1}H_{y,1}&=\frac{k_{z,2}}{\epsilon_2}H_{y,2}\\ 
%\Aboxed{
%\frac{k_{z,1}}{\epsilon_1}&=\frac{k_{z,2}}{\epsilon_2} 
%}
%\label{eqn:sprcondition}
%\end{align}
%This is the surface plasmon resonance condition.  In terms of
%its vector components, the following holds in general for all electromagnetic
%waves
%\begin{align}
%\mathbf{k}^2=\epsilon_i \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2=k_x^2 + k_{z,i}^2\\
%\epsilon_i k_0^2=k_x^2 + k_{z,i}^2
%\label{eqn:dispersion1}
%\end{align}
%Substitution of \Equation{eqn:sprcondition} with the relation 
%$k_{x,1}=k_{x,2}$ into \Equation{eqn:dispersion1} allows 
%$k_x$ and $k_{z,i}$ to be rewritten in the form of a dispersion relation
%\begin{align}
%k_x &= k_0\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_1 \epsilon_2}{\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2}} 
%= \frac{\omega}{c}\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_1 \epsilon_2}{\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2}}\\
%k_{z,i} &= k_0\frac{\epsilon_i}{\sqrt{\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2}}
%= \frac{\omega}{c}\frac{\epsilon_i}{\sqrt{\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2}}
%\end{align}
%
%This relation, shown in \Figure{fig:dispersionrelation}, is useful because
%it shows graphically the condition under which SPPs may exist: at the
%intersection between the photon light line and corresponding SPP light line
%for the medium in question.  Note that for a photon and a plasmon in both a
%vacuum and a dielectric, this never happens; the photon assumes $\omega = c
%k /\sqrt{\epsilon_i}$ for $i=1,2$, diverging to infinity while the SPP
%asymptotically approaches $\omega_p/\sqrt{1+\epsilon_i}$ as $k_x\to\infty$.
%However, if light is incident from a dielectric $\epsilon_1$ at an angle
%$\theta$, the slope of $\omega(k_x)$ is modified to $c k \sin
%\theta/\sqrt{\epsilon_1}$ and the dispersion relations can be matched.
%This is the principle exploited by Kretschmann \cite{kretschmann1968} to
%excite SPPs with prisms.
%
%There are several regions of interest in \Figure{fig:dispersionrelation},
%depending on the relative value of $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$.  We first
%assume that $\epsilon_1$ is a dielectric with $\epsilon_1\in\mathbb{R}$ and
%$\epsilon_1 > 0$ (true for most if not all glass).  In this case, for
%$\Re(\epsilon_2)>0$, both $k_x$ and $k_z$ are real.  These are known as
%``radiative modes'' -- an SPP mode is supported normal to the interface but
%it is not bound there.  For $-\epsilon_1<\Re(\epsilon_2)<0$, $k_z$ is real
%and $k_x$ imaginary.  The SPP is not confined to the interface and decays
%evanescently there; this is known as a ``quasi-bound mode''  However, for
%$\Re(\epsilon_2)<-\epsilon_1$, $k_x$ is real and $k_z$ is imaginary.  This
%indicates the SPP is localized at the interface in $z$ while having a
%propagating solution in $x$, and is exactly the condition we wish to match.

%
%\subsection{Resonance Condition}
%The resonance condition requires the dispersion relation for an
%incident photon intersect the dispersion relation for SPPs, matching both
%their in-plane momentum and phase.  This can be achieved by if the photon
%is indecent through a dielectric at an $\theta_\text{sp}$, causing its phase
%velocity $\omega/k_x$ to be reduced to  $\omega/k_x = c/(\sqrt{\epsilon_1}
%\sin \theta)$.  One simple and popular prism coupled configuration (the one
%which will be employed throughout this work) which is able to match these
%conditions is known as the Kretschmann attenuated total reflection (ATR)
%configuration, and is shown schematically in \Figure{fig:kretschmanngeo}.
%Here a thin ($\sim \SI{50}{\nano\meter}$) metal film is deposited on to the
%hypotenuse of a dielectric prism, and the totally internally reflected
%light evanescently excites SPPs.  The SPP resonance condition for this
%system is
%\begin{align}
%k_\text{sp}=k_0 \sqrt{\epsilon_1} \sin \theta_\text{sp} 
%\end{align}
%Note that practically this can only occur when both the width of the metal
%layer $d$ is less than the evanescent decay in that direction
%$\Im(1/k_{z,2})$ (causing the metal to be nearly transparent) and the
%incident light satisfies the condition for total internal reflection.  This 
%is approximately when
%\begin{align}
%\theta>\arcsin\left(\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_1}{\epsilon_3}}\right)
%\end{align} 
%In practice the resonance angle $\theta_\text{sp}$ is most easily found by
%numerically evaluating the Fresnel relations discussed in the following
%section.
%
%\subsection{Fresnel Relations}
%Many features of surface plasmon resonance can be predicted using the
%Fresnel relations and the transfer matrix method (TMM) for multilayer
%stacks.
%The Fresnel reflection coefficient $\tilde{r}$ is defined as the ratio of the
%reflected beam $\tilde{E}_r$ to the incident beam
%$\tilde{E}_i$
%\begin{align}
%\tilde{r} &= \frac{\tilde{E}_r}{\tilde{E}_i}
%\end{align}
%Here the presence of a tilde $\sim$ indicates a function in the (spatial)
%frequency domain.  For multilayer systems, this is found through
%the transfer matrix method where the $i$th matrix $M_i$ is
%\begin{align}
%M_i = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
%\cos \sigma_i & \mi \sin \sigma_i / \gamma_i\\
%\mi \gamma_i \sin \sigma_i & \cos \sigma_i
%\end{array}\right)
%\label{eqn:tmm}
%\end{align}
%and the system matrix $M_s = M_1 M_2 \ldots M_{n-1} M_n$.  In the above
%representation
%\begin{align}
%\left.\begin{aligned}
%\gamma_i &= \sqrt{\epsilon_i} k_{z,i}\\
%\sigma_i &= k_{z,i} \sqrt{\epsilon_i} d_i
%\end{aligned}

%\subsection{Physical Properties}
%Physical properties of SPP propagation are derived from $k_x$ and $k_z$.
%Since the SPP is confined to the plane of the metal, the surface plasmon
%wavelength $\lambda_\text{sp}$ is defined in terms of the real part of
%$k_x$
%\begin{align}
%\lambda_\text{sp} &= \frac{\lambda_0}{2 \pi} k_x\\
%& = \Re\left(\sqrt{
%  \frac {\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2}
%   {\epsilon_1 \epsilon_2 \lambda_0^2}
%}\right)
%\end{align}
%when $k_x$ is imaginary, \Equation{eqn:planewavexz} is evanescent in
%$x$ and the SPP decays with a characteristic $1/\me$ lifetime
%$\Im(1/(2k_x)$.  Similarly, when $k_{z,i}$ is imaginary, the
%$1/\me$ evanescent decay into either the metal or vacuum is given by
%$\Im(1/k_{z,i})$.  A table of these properties for many different SPP
%excitation configurations is found in \Appendix{ref:physicalproperties}.
%
%\section{Long Range Surface Plasmon Polaritons}
%The typical propagation distances for SPPs in the three layer Kretschmann
%configuration are on the order of $\SI{30}{\nano\meter}$ for Ag films and
%$\SI{6}{\nano\meter}$ for Au films.  The reason for this is the electric
%field extends into the metal and the real part of the metal's dielectric
%function damps the SPP oscillation, causing it to decay as heat.  However,
%if we are able to expel the SPP evanescent field from the metal region, the
%propagation distances can be extended orders of magnitude.  These are
%called \textit{long range surface plasmon polaritons} (LRSPPs), and in
%terms of our geometry can be excited in one of two ways.

%\chapter{Experimental Setup}
%\label{ch:expsetup}
%
%The experimental setup is depicted schematically in
%\Figure{fig:sppexperimentalsetup}.  Light from a \SI{660}{\nano\meter}
%diode laser is first coupled into a single mode optical fiber.  The fiber
%guides the laser light to an optical breadboard mounted on an inverted
%microscope.  All primary functions of the experiment take place here.  The
%Gaussian output from the single mode fiber is collimnated with a beam waist
%$w_0=\SI{5}{\milli\meter}$ and proceeds
%through a polarizing beamsplitter, passing $p$ polarized light.  This light
%is focussed by a 10x microscope objective onto the
%hypotenuse of a hemispherical prism.  The prism is mounted on a planar
%structure supporting either normal or long range SPPs.  Reverse of this
%structure is a microfluidic flow cell where samples can be injected.  The
%specularly reflected and scattered light containing information from SPP
%interference and scattering is ultimately captured at desired locations by
%a pair of custom beam profilers. (notch filter).

%\section{Planar Layer Structure}
%Perhaps most important to the setup is the layer structure supporting SPP
%propagation.  Two types of structures were created for this work: ones for
%SPPs and LRSPPs.
%
%
%\section{Spin Coater}
%During our experimental work, we did not have convienent access to a
%standard programmable spin coater.  This is of course a pre-requisite to
%producing uniform cytop coatings and thus long range surface plasmons.
%Being a rather expensive piece of equipment, we opted to build one
%ourselves using the brushless DC motor from a repurposed hard disk drive.
%Spin coaters built this way have been reported
%before~\cite{bianchi2006spin}, but we have made enough improvements on the
%design to justify its inclusion here.  Most significantly, the entire
%electronic drive and control are put together from off the shelf
%components.
%
%A block diagram of our home-built spin coater is shown in \Figure{fig:x}.
%The cover from a hard disk drive is removed and all of the internal
%components except for the motor are removed.  A solid aluminum plate is
%affixed to the top of the motor using the existing screw taps.  The motor
%is then connected directly to a programmable electronic speed controller
%(ESC).  The ESC itself is a standard component found in most land and air
%based radio controlled drones.  Once configured, the ESC accepts a pulse
%width modulated (PWM) input with pulse widths varying from \num{1000} (off)
%to \SI{2000}{\micro\second} (full speed).  The PWM signal for the ESC is
%generated by an Arduino Uno platform, based on the Atmel ATMega128
%\SI{8}{bit} microcontroller.  The Arduino can be programmed to do spins on
%its own, but we found it more convienent to send the desired spin speeds in
%real time to the Arduino via its USB serial interface.  Finally, connected
%to the motor spindle is a small flange and an optical interrupter switch
%which serves to monitor the spin speed.  
%
%We have experimented with using the optical interrupter as feedback for a
%proportional-integral-derivative (PID) loop in hopes that this would be a
%superior way of controlling the motor, but this idea was abandoned in favor
%of a proportional-only feedback loop.  The spin speed of the motor was also
%calibrated offline and a linear relationship with the PWM output determined
%such that it could function equally well without feedback.  
%
%The stability of the spin coater and the range of speeds it offers is shown
%in \Table{tbl:spincoatererror}.  Perhaps the most obvious downside of the
%ESC is that it does not operate very well in the low RPM limit.
%Fortunately, this is not an issue for us.

%\chapter{Interference}
%\label{ch:interference}
%Don't say this, but maybe say something like it
%Surface plasmon resonance is in of itself an interference phenomena: the dark band in the specular direction is due to interference between
%specularly reflected light and the re-radiated SPP which is likewise
%antiphase at the SPR resonance angle.  There is, however, a more rich 
%interference structure which can observed when using a focused beam whose spot size is smaller than the SPP propagation distance.  
%

%\section{The Fourier Optics Perspective}
%There are several perspectives of SPR phenomena which can be insightful in
%explaining why exactly the spatial oscillations are one-sided.  The first
%is an argument from causality.  Assume a complex function $\chi(\omega) =
%\chi'(\omega) + \mi \chi''(\omega)$ whose real and imaginary parts are
%related by Kramers-Kronig relations
%\begin{align}
%\chi(\omega)=\mi \hf{\chi(\omega)}
%\end{align}
%with 
%\begin{align}
%\chi'(\omega) &= \hf{\chi''(\omega)}\\
%\chi''(\omega) &= -\hf{\chi'(\omega)}
%\end{align}
%where $\hf{\chi(\omega)}$ is the Hilbert transform of $\chi(\omega)$.
%The Fourier transform of $\chi(\omega)$ is
%\begin{align}
%\chi(\omega) &= \chi'(\omega) + \mi \chi''(\omega)\\
%\ff{\chi(\omega)} &= \ff{\chi'(\omega) + \mi \chi''(\omega)}\\
%&= \ff{\chi'(\omega)} + \ff{\mi \chi''(\omega)}\\
%&= \ff{\chi'(\omega)} + \ff{\mi \hf{\chi'(\omega)}} \\
%&= \ff{\chi'(\omega)} + \sgn(\omega) \ff{\chi'(\omega)} \\
%\end{align}
%Or succinctly,
%\begin{align}
%\ff{\hf{\chi(\omega)}} = (-\mi \sgn(\omega)) \ff{\chi(\omega)}
%\end{align}
%In other words, the Fourier transform of any function which satisfies
%Kramers-Kronig relations is ``one-sided'' as a necessary
%condition of causality.  This seems to be true for the Fresnel
%reflectivity as well as the complex permittivity.
%
%The second perspective is couched in Fourier optics.  Here, because
%SPR occurs at the focus of a Gaussian beam, it can be seen as a sort of
%spatial filter which modifies the local $k$-vectors to produce
%the resulting far field optical pattern.  If the SPR resonance condition is
%sharp, the Fourier integral (\Equation{eqn:fourier123}) is truncated and
%the discontinuity acts as a low pass filter for light.  The one-sided
%oscillations are then essentially a manifestation of Gibb's phenomena.
%This seems to be well supported, because if the SPR resonance is broadened,
%say in the case of a BK7-Au-\ce{H2O} system, the interference is greatly
%attenuated.
%%
%%Another possible interpretation is that the near and
%%far field patterns in conically scattered light are qualatatively identical
%%to the simple impulse-response of a forced, damped harmonic oscillator.
%%This is of course equivalent to what the Lorentz-Drude model says about the
%%material properties.  The far field conically scattered light likewise
%%appears to be equivalent to the energy absorbed in the metal film which can
%%be detected as heat.
%
%\subsection{Specularly Directed Light}
%
%
%\subsection{Spatial Evolution}
%The Fresnel reflectivity predicts the far field angular distribution when
%illuminated by light at a specific angle, consisting of a single
%$k$-vector.  Now we will look at the evolution of light from this system
%as it propagates to the far field when excited by an incident Gaussian beam
%$g(x)$ containing a continuum of $k$-vectors.  We begin with treatment of
%light in the specular direction.  In the context of Fourier
%optics, the field on the surface in $k$-space is described by the Fourier
%decomposed incident Gaussian beam $\tilde{g}(k_x)$ multiplied by the
%Fresnel reflectivity
%\begin{align}
%\tilde{E}_\text{spec}(k_x)=\tilde{g}(k_x)\,\tilde{r}_\text{123}(k_x)
%\end{align}
%where
%\begin{align}
%\tilde{g}(k_x) = \intinfty g(x)\, \me^{\mi k_x x} \md x
%\end{align}
%and $g(x)$ represents a Gaussian beam in spatial dimensions.  We omit any 
%specific definition for $g(x)$ because its exact form
%is not important to our analysis.
%
%The complete optical field in both $x$ and $z$ can be obtained by computing
%the Fourier transform of $\tilde{E}_\text{spec}(k_x)$ multiplied 
%by the free space transfer function $\me^{\mi k_{z,1} z}$
%\begin{align}
%E_\text{spec}(x,z) &= \intinfty \tilde{E}_\text{spec}\, \me^{\mi k_{z,1} z}\, \me^{\mi k_x x} \md k_x\\
% &= \intinfty \tilde{g}(k_x)\, \tilde{r}_{123}(k_x)\, \me^{\mi \sqrt{k_0^2 \epsilon_1 - k_x^2}z}\, \me^{\mi k_x x} \md k_x
%\label{eqn:fourier123}
%\end{align}
%Likewise, conically scattered light may be found using the same treatment
%\begin{align}
%E_\text{cone}(x,z) = \intinfty \tilde{g}(k_x)\, \tilde{r}_{321}(k_x)\,\me^{\mi k_{z,1} z}\, \me^{\mi k_x x} \md k_x
%\label{eqn:fourier321}
%\end{align}
%Though this integral seems to have no analytic solution, its evaluation is
%nonetheless straightforward on a computer.
%The evolution of scattered and specularly directed light based on
%\Equation{eqn:fourier123} and \Equation{eqn:fourier321} is shown in
%\Figure{fig:fresnelpropagate} as a function of distance from the 2-3
%interface.  As can be seen, as the field propagates it diffracts,
%displaying a one-sided oscillatory structure. 
%
%\subsubsection{Evanescent Solutions}
%In the context of diffraction integrals, the free space transfer function
%$\exp(\mi k_{z,1} z)$ is often concerned with evanescent and propagating
%terms, giving rise to the diffraction limit.  Here,
%$k_{z,1}=\sqrt{k_0^2 \epsilon_1 - k_x^2}$ is imaginary for $k_0^2
%\epsilon_1 < k_x^2$.  It is interesting to note that this never occurs.
%Ignoring the condition for total internal reflection, 
%$k_x = k_0 \sqrt{\epsilon_1} \sin \theta$ and we can set up an inequality
%\begin{align}
%k_0^2 \epsilon_1 &< k_x^2\\
%k_0^2 \epsilon_1 &< \left(k_0 \sqrt{\epsilon_1} \sin \theta\right)^2\\
%k_0^2 \epsilon_1 &< k_0^2 \epsilon_1 \sin^2 \theta\\
%1 &< \sin^2 \theta
%\end{align}
%which is false, suggesting that if all light is collected, no information is
%lost during propagation from the near to far field.
%
%
%\chapter{Bulk Sensitivity}
%\label{ch:bulksensitivity}
%The sensitivity of surface plasmon based biosensors to bulk refractive
%index changes is of primary importance in extracting bio-relevant
%properties. In a prism coupled setup, there are three main modulation
%methods used to monitor changes in the SPR resonance.
%
%\begin{description}
% \item [{Angular}] The prism is rotated and the signal reflectivity
%  monitored
%  as a function of angle. The prism may be scanned through a range of
%  angles or the angular spectrum may be obtained simultaneously using
%  a focussed beam and sensor array.
% \item [{Wavelength}] The prism is fixed in place and its reflectivity at
%  a single angle is monitored as a function of wavelength.
% \item [{Intensity}] The intensity of the signal at a certain angular or
%  spatial point is monitored as the experiment progresses.
%\end{description}
%All three of these interrogation methods are equivalent in terms of
%their real-world resolution and detection limit. In this section we
%will look at the sensitivity of intensity interrogation to different
%(something about parameters)
%
%
%\section{Three Layer Kretschmann, Far Field}
%We will now derive the sensitivity of the three layer Kretschmann
%configuration to bulk index changes. This case will be used as a test
%case for further analysis of the propagation dependent sensitivity.
%
%The bulk sensitivity in an intensity modulation setup is defined as
%the ratio of the change of normalized signal intensity $\delta I=I_{n_{0}}-I_{n_{1}}$
%to the change in bulk refractive index $\delta n=n_{0}-n_{1}$ for
%two refractive indicies $n_{0}$ and $n_{1}$. We restrict ourselves
%to small changes in the refractive index $n$, $\delta n/n_{0}\ll1$.
%The intensity sensitivity is defined as
%\begin{equation}
%S_{\mathrm{I}}=\frac{\delta I}{\delta n}
%\end{equation}
%Without loss of generality, the sensor intensity $I$ may be a function
%of any appropriate coordinate system (e.g. $I(x,y)$). In such a coordinate
%system we always take $S_{\mathrm{I}}$ at the location of maximum
%shift in that coordinate system.
%
%In the Lorentzian approximation{[}{]} using Drude model coefficents
%$\epsilon=\epsilon'+\mi\epsilon''$, the maximum sensitivity for bulk
%index sensing is approximated as
%\begin{equation}
%(S_{\text{I}})_{\text{max}}=\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{9}\frac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{m}}'}{\epsilon_{\mathrm{m}}''n^{3}}
%\end{equation}
%Where $\epsilon_{\mathrm{m}}$ is the complex Drude-model permittivity
%in the metal layer. At a operating wavelength of \SI{660}{\nano\meter},
%for Au on N-BK7, $(S_{\mathrm{I}})_{\text{max}}=151.66$. This is
%only an approximation, though it is close to the value obtained through
%Lorentz-Drude coefficents used in combination with the transfer matrix
%method, $(S_{\mathrm{I}})_{\text{max}}=153.04$.
%
%\section{Long Range Surface Plasmons (Four Layer Kretschmann)}
%
%
%\subsection{Optimizing Sensitivity}
%
%The quoted values of $(S_{\mathrm{I}})_{\text{max}}$ depend on the
%refractive indicies of the system layers as well as the thickness
%of the metal layer. It is interesting to note that the maximum sensitivity
%does not coincide with maximum coupling of light into SPPs. The plot
%in Figure X shows the relationship between sensitivity and metal thickness.
%
%It can also be shown that the width of the signal is related to the
%sensitivity. 
%
%
%\section{Propagation Dependent Sensitivity}
%
%Having analyzed the classical case of SPR sensitivity in the three
%layer Kretschmann configuration, we are now ready to look at the propagation
%dependent sensitivity. 
%
%
%\subsection{Theoretical Maximum Sensitivity for an Arbitrary Signal}
%
%Consider an arbitrary complex signal of some coordinate $f(x)$ such
%that the indefinite integral
%\begin{equation}
%\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|f(x)|^{2}\md x=\text{(some finite value)}
%\end{equation}
% and
%\begin{equation}
%\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}|f(x)|^{2}=0
%\end{equation}
%Specifically $f(x)$ must be \textit{band-limited}. Following, it is
%completely determined by its Fourier series.
%
%1/range is the spacing
%1/dx is the range
%minimum frequency is zero (nyquist)
%maximum frequency is N/range
%
%maximum frequency determines the maximum derivative of the signal
%
%% We have to choose a resolution for sampling so that we introduce no error
%% in the signal.  So the band in which we cut off is determined by the
%% error we're willing to deal with.
%
%% Just define error as the least squares error
%% choose bounds such that the least squares error is at most x
%% 
%
%
%
%\section{Conically Scattered Light}
%
%As described in X, light can also be directionally scattered into
%the cone. This propagation contains the same interference structure
%as the specularly reflected light, and is likewise subject to the
%same analysis.
%
%
%\section{Multiple Scattering Effects}

%is more sensitive to some kind of fixed phase stuff

%\chapter{Simulations}
%\label{ch:simulations}
%A parallel Monte Carlo simulation was written to model surface plasmon
%random scattering in our experiment. This simulation is capable of modeling
%a comprehensive set of phenomena expected to exist in this work: single
%scattering, multiple scattering, the effects of moving scatterers, and the
%effects of adding scatterers. The simulation assumes a geometery shown in
%Figure X, consisting of:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item A \textit{scatterer}, a fixed point where an SPP can scatter to
%another scatterer or exit the system to the far field.
%
%\item An elliptical \textit{illuminated region}, representing the incident
%evanescent field which excites SPPs.
%
%\item A \textit{trajectory} or \textit{path}, meaning the ordered sequence
%of scatterers a plasmon visits before exiting the system. This path is
%characterized by its path length and mean free path. A path always begins
%in the illuminated region.
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%The plasmon is assumed to propagate according to the time independent
%monochromatic wave equation, $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})=\me^{\mi
%\mathrm{k}\cdot \mathrm{r}}$, where $\mathrm{k}$ is the plasmon wavevector
%and $\mathrm{r}$ is the spatial variable.
